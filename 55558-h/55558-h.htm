  <h2 class='c005'>DEDICATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To the <span class='sc'>Young Ladies of America</span>, the following
sheets are affectionately inscribed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Convinced of the many advantages of a good education,
and the importance of improving those advantages;
or of counterbalancing the want of them by
exerting the mental powers which nature has bestowed;
sensible, too, that the foundation of a useful and happy
life must be laid in youth, and that much depends on
the early infusion of virtuous principles into the docile
mind, the author has employed a part of her leisure
hours in collecting and arranging her ideas on the subject
of female deportment.</p>

<p class='c000'>How far she has succeeded in her design, the voice
of a candid public will pronounce.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 id='SCHOOL' class='c005'><span class='large'>THE</span><br /> BOARDING SCHOOL, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the delightful margin of the Merrimac,
in one of the most pleasant and beautiful situations,
which that fertile and healthful part of
America affords, lived Mrs. Williams, the virtuous
relict of a respectable clergyman.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had two daughters, lovely and promising
as ever parent could boast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Williams’ circumstances were easy.
She possessed a little patrimony, to which she
retired, after her husband’s decease; but a
desire of preserving this for her children, and
a wish to promote their advantage and enlarge
their society, induced her to open a Boarding
School.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she had an eye, no less to the social
pleasure, than to the pecuniary profit of the
undertaking, she admitted only seven, at a
time, to the privilege of her tuition.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were all young ladies, who had previously
received the first rudiments of learning,
and been initiated into the polite accomplishments,
which embellish virtue and soften
the cares of human life. They had generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>lived in the metropolis, and had acquired the
graces of a fashionable deportment; but they
possessed different tempers and dispositions,
which had been variously, and, in some respects,
erroneously managed.</p>

<p class='c000'>To cultivate the expanding flowers, and to
prune the juvenile eccentricities, which were
disseminated among these tender plants; or,
to speak without a figure, to extend and purify
their ideas, to elevate and refine their affections,
to govern and direct their passions,
required an eye, watchful, and a hand, skilful
as those of the judicious Mrs. Williams.</p>

<p class='c000'>While her judgment and prudence aided the
useful acquisitions of the mind, a sprightly
fancy and a cheerful disposition, regulated by
experience and discretion, qualified her to enter,
at once, with becoming dignity and condescending
ease, into all their concerns; to
participate their pleasures; while, with candor
and mildness, she reproved their errors, detected
their follies, and facilitated their amendment.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the young ladies had finished their school
education, before Mrs. Williams received them
to her mansion, her instructions were more
especially designed to polish the mental part,
to call forth the dormant virtues, to unite and
arrange the charms of person and mind, to
inspire a due sense of decorum and propriety,
and to instil such principles of piety, morality,
benevolence, prudence and economy, as might
be useful through life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Their time was, accordingly, disposed in a
manner most conducive to the attainment of
these objects. Every part of it was employed
to some valuable purpose; “for idleness,”
Mrs. Williams observed, “is the rust of the
mind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever tended to enlarge, inform, improve,
or amuse, she supposed worthy their
attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>She particularly endeavored to domesticate
them; to turn their thoughts to the beneficial
and necessary qualifications of private life;
often inculcating, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nothing lovelier can be found in woman</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to study household good;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and laboring to convince them of the utter insignificance
and uselessness of that part of the
sex, who are</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bred only and completed to the taste</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lustful appetence; to sing, to dance,</div>
      <div class='line'>To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Early rising she recommended, both by
precept and example. This, she said, would
not only promote their health, but render them
mistresses of many hours, which must otherwise
be lost in enervating sloth and inaction.
“And should we,” continued she, “who have
so much cause for exertion, thus sacrifice the
best part of our time?”</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Falsely luxurious, will not man awake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, starting from the bed of sloth, enjoy</div>
      <div class='line'>The cool, the fragrant, and the silent hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>To meditation due, and sacred song?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>And is there aught in sleep can charm the wise?</div>
      <div class='line'>To lie in dead oblivion, losing half</div>
      <div class='line'>The fleeting moments of too short a life?</div>
      <div class='line'>Total extinction of th’ enlighten’d soul!</div>
      <div class='line'>Or else to feverish vanity alive,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wilder’d and tossing through distemper’d dreams?</div>
      <div class='line'>Who would in such a gloomy state remain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Longer than nature craves; when every muse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every blooming pleasure wait without,</div>
      <div class='line'>To bless the wildly devious morning walk?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another laudable practice of Mrs. Williams,
was perfect regularity in the government of
her pupils, and in the arrangement of their
daily exercises. “When,” said she, “we
observe the order of the natural world, and
admire the consistency and harmony of every
part, we may hence derive a lesson, for the
regulation of our conduct, in the sphere assigned
to us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pursuant to this plan of operation, the young
ladies arose at five; from which they had two
hours at their own disposal, till the bell summoned
them at seven, to the hall, where, the
ceremonies of the morning salutation over,
they breakfasted together; their repast being
seasoned with the unrestrained effusions of
good humor and sociability. On these occasions,
Mrs. Williams suspended the authority
of the matron, that, by accustoming her pupils
to familiarity in her presence, they might be
free from restraint; and, feeling perfectly easy
and unawed, appear in their genuine characters.
By this means she had an opportunity
of observing any indecorum of behavior, or
wrong bias; which she kept in mind, till a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>proper time to mention, and remonstrate
against it; a method, the salutary effects of
which were visible in the daily improvement
of her pupils.</p>

<p class='c000'>The breakfast table removed, each took her
needle-work, except one, who read some
amusing and instructive book, for the benefit
and entertainment of the rest. The subject
was selected by Mrs. Williams, who conferred
the reading upon them in rotation.</p>

<p class='c000'>At twelve o’clock, they were dismissed till
one, when dinner again called them together,
which was conducted in the same manner as
the morning repast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having resumed their occupations, the reader
of the day produced some piece of her own
composition, either in prose, or verse, according
to her inclination, as a specimen of her
genius and improvement. This being submitted
to Mrs. Williams’ inspection, and the
candid perusal and criticism of her companions;
and the subject canvassed with great
freedom of opinion, they withdrew from the
tasks of the day to seek that relaxation and
amusement, which each preferred. No innocent
gratification was denied them. The
sprightly dance, the sentimental song, and
indeed every species of pastime, consistent
with the decorum of the sex, was encouraged,
as tending to health, cheerfulness, and alacrity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In these pleasing pursuits and enjoyments,
the present class of happy companions had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>nearly completed the term allotted them by
their parents, and were soon to leave the
peaceful shades in which they delighted, when
being assembled on the Monday morning of
their last week, their revered Preceptress thus
accosted them:</p>

<p class='c000'>“As the period is approaching, my dear
pupils, when I must resign your society, and
quit the important charge of instructer and
friend, which I have sustained with so much
pleasure, and, I trust, with some degree of
fidelity, I shall sum up the counsels, admonitions,
and advice, which I have frequently inculcated,
and endeavor to impress them on
your minds, as my valedictory address. For
this purpose, during this last week of your
residence with me, I shall dispense with your
usual exercises, and substitute a collection of
my own sentiments, enforced by the pathos of
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your docility, and cheerful diligence in
attending to my instructions; your modest,
affectionate, and respectful behavior, together
with the laudable progress you have made
in every branch, which you have pursued, have
well rewarded my care, and engaged my approbation
and love. To me, therefore, a separation
will be painful. To you the period is
important. It is a period, which, while it relieves
you from the confinement of scholastic
rules, introduces you to new scenes of cares,
of pleasures, of trials, and of temptations,
which will call for the exercise of every virtue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and afford opportunity for improving the
endowments, both natural and acquired, which
you possess. Think not then, that your emancipation
from schools, gives you liberty to neglect
the advantages which you have received
from them. The obligations under which you
are laid to your parents for the education they
have given you, require a diligent improvement
of every talent committed to your trust.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of needle-work you are complete mistresses,
from the most delicate and highly finished,
to the most ordinary, though perhaps
not less useful, economy of mending and making
the coarser garments of family use. Many,
I am aware, suppose <em>this last</em> a species of
learning, which is beneath the attention of a
lady: but Clara will tell you how valuable it
has proved to her; and how valuable it <em>may</em>
prove to you.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nursed in the lap of affluence, and accustomed
to unbounded expense, Clara little
thought, at your age, that she should ever depend
on her needle for the livelihood and decent
appearance of a rising family. A discreet
and prudent mother early inculcated the lessons
of industry and economy, which she now
practices; and taught her that the knowledge
could be of no disservice, though she never
had occasion for it. She married with the
brightest prospects. But a series of unavoidable
disasters, such as no human wisdom
could foresee or prevent, reduced her to narrow
circumstances; and, to complete her misfortune,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>she was left a widow with four small
children. Her parents were in the grave; her
patrimony was gone! In this exigence what
was her resource? Not fruitless lamentations,
and unavailing complaints. She immediately
summoned her resolution; and by the use of
her needle has ever since supported herself
and family with decency, and been highly respected
for her prudent exertions and exemplary
industry. Directly the reverse of this
amiable character is that of Belinda. She
was educated in the same way with Clara; the
same schools gave them tuition; and similar
prospects awaited their entrance into life.
Calamities attended the progress of each; but
different as their tempers and dispositions was
their conduct under them. The falling fortunes
of Clara were awhile suspended by her
discretion and frugality; while the ruin of Belinda
was hastened by her extravagance, dissipation,
and idleness. View them, now, in
their reduced state! Neatness, cheerfulness,
and activity preside in the dwelling of Clara;
negligence, peevishness, and sloth are legibly
stamped on that of Belinda. The ear is pained
by her complaints of poverty; the eye is
disgusted by her slatternly appearance, and ostentatious
display of the tattered remnants of
finery, which bespeak the pride and indolence
of their owner; who will neither convert them
into more comfortable garments, nor, by repairing,
render them becoming.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope, however, that occasions like these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>may never call for your exertions. But there
may be cases, when, to know the use of your
needles will answer important purposes, even
in an exalted station, and amidst the splendor
of affluence and plenty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Matilda dignified a princely fortune by
the exercise of every virtue which can adorn
a lady. Among these, charity shone conspicuous.
Her maid said to her, one day, Madam,
would you have me lay aside these cast-clothes
for some poor person? Yes, replied
Matilda; but sit down, and mend them first.
Don’t you see they need it? Why, Madam,
rejoined the girl, is it not enough for you to
give them away? I should think the least
they can do is to mend them for themselves!
In that case, said Matilda, my bounty would
be greatly diminished. People, who need
charity have not the necessary materials for
putting such articles into repair; and should I
furnish them, perhaps they have never been
taught to use their needles. No more have
I, returned the maid. Have you not? said
Matilda. Well then, sit down, and I will direct
your ingenuity upon these clothes. By
this mean you may learn a very useful lesson,
I assure you; a lesson, which by practising
for yourself, will enable you to lay up part of
your wages against the time when sickness or
old age shall take you from your labors.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such examples of condescension and benevolence
to inferiors, are of more real and
lasting use than pounds prodigally bestowed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Do you seek higher testimonies of the
honor and utility of this employment? You
may collect many from the histories which you
have read during the last year. Among the
Romans, and several other nations of antiquity,
a scarf, wrought by the needle of a favorite
fair, was received as an honorable token of
respect, and improved as an invincible stimulus
to heroic deeds. Ladies of the first rank
and station considered it as no derogation from
the dignity or delicacy of their character, to
make their own apparel, and that of their families.
The virtuous Panthea, when her husband
was going to fight in the cause of Cyrus,
her generous deliverer, magnificently adorned
his person, and decorated his armor with her
own needle-work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We ought never to be idle. No moment
should be unoccupied. Some employment,
salutary, either to body or mind, or both, should
be constantly pursued; and the needle is always
at hand to supply the want of other avocations.
The listless vacuity, which some
young ladies indulge, renders them extremely
unhappy, though they are insensible of the
cause and seek to beguile the time in frivolous
amusements.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A still more endearing motive remains to
be suggested; and that is the pleasure, which
your accomplishments in this ornamental and
useful art must afford your parents; and the
pain, which your neglect of it hereafter must
occasion them.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>READING.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Being assembled, this afternoon, Mrs. Williams
thus resumed her discourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Reading is so common a part of education,
that the value of it is not duly estimated; nor
the manner of performing it, sufficiently attended
to. It is not the mere propriety of pronunciation,
accent, and cadence, which constitutes
good reading. You must enter into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>the spirit of the subject, and feel interested in
the matter, before you can profit by the exercise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you are so well acquainted with the
manner of reading, that the quality of books
most worthy of your perusal is the only point
on which I need to enlarge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Romances, the taste of former times, are
now so far out of vogue, that it is hardly necessary
to warn you against them. They exhibit
the spirit of chivalry, knight-errantry,
and extravagant folly, which prevailed in the
age they depict. But they are not interesting;
nor can they be pleasing to the correct
taste and refined delicacy of the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Novels, are the favorite and the most dangerous
kind of reading, now adopted by the
generality of young ladies. I say dangerous,
because the influence, which, with very few
exceptions, they must have upon the passions
of youth, bears an unfavorable aspect on their
purity and virtue. The style in which they
are written is commonly captivating; and the
luxuriance of the descriptions with which they
abound, extremely agreeable to the sprightly
fancy, and high expectations of the inexperienced
and unreflecting. Their romantic pictures
of love, beauty, and magnificence, fill
the imagination with ideas which lead to impure
desires, a vanity of exterior charms, and
a fondness for show and dissipation, by no
means consistent with that simplicity, modesty,
and chastity, which should be the constant inmates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of the female breast. They often pervert
the judgment, mislead the affections, and
blind the understanding.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A melancholy example of this sort is exhibited
in Juliana. Juliana was the only
daughter of a wealthy merchant, who grudged
no expense which could please or embellish
his darling child. He, however, possessed
neither leisure nor abilities ‘to teach the young
idea how to shoot;’ but thought it sufficient
that he gave her every advantage, which
could be derived from the various schools, to
which she was consigned. She had a brilliant
fancy, and a fondness for books, which,
properly directed, might have proved of great
use to her. But, having no better principles
instilled into her mind, she indulged herself in
the unlimited reading of novels, and every
light publication which a circulating library
could furnish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hence her imagination took wing, and
carried her far above the scenes of common
life. The excessive refinement of her mind
admitted no ordinary amusements or avocations.
Plain truth from her own sex was an
insult; and from the other, nothing less than
adoration would satisfy her unbounded vanity.
Her beauty (of which she really had a considerable
share) and the large fortune which she
would probably inherit, gained her many admirers;
some of whom were men of unquestionable
merit. But a sober, rational courtship
could not answer her ideas of love and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>gallantry. The swain, who would not die for
her, she deemed unworthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her father strongly recommended a gentleman,
as well calculated, in his opinion, to
make her happy, and as having his entire approbation;
but she rejected him with disdain,
though she could produce no one objection
against his person, or character.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her father acquiesced; expressing, however,
his regret at the mistaken notions she
had imbibed; and warning her most pathetically
against the indulgence of so romantic a
disposition; yet all in vain. He was considered
as an illiterate plodder after wealth,
which she had a right to bestow as she pleased.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At last the lovely youth whom she had so
long contemplated, made his appearance. A
military captain entered the town on the recruiting
service. Young, handsome, easy,
bold and assuming; with all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon ton</span></i> of the
coxcomb, and all the insolence of the novice.
He saw Juliana; he sacrificed to her charms,
and conquered. She could not resist the allurements
of his gallantry. His affectation
of dying love was received with apparent pleasure;
while art and duplicity took advantage
of her weakness, to precipitate her into engagements
to pity and relieve him. Her
friends saw her danger, and warmly remonstrated
against her imprudent conduct, in receiving
the addresses of a man, destitute of
property to support her, and void of every
kind of personal merit. Her father entreated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and implored the rejection of her lover, till,
finding every other method vain, he at length resolutely
forbade him the house, and his daughter’s
company. This was viewed as persecution;
and, consistently with her sentiments of
adventurous love, a clandestine amour was
commenced. Her father surprised them together;
and, enraged at their disgraceful intrigue,
seized the captain, and endeavored to
turn him out of doors. He violently resented
this ungentlemanlike treatment, as he termed
it, and defended himself with his sword. The
old gentleman received a slight wound in the
scuffle; but accomplished his purpose. Juliana
was terrified at this rencounter, and,
dreading her father’s displeasure, ran out with
her paramour. His lodgings were near, and
thither, favored by the darkness of the night,
he instantly led her. She involuntarily followed
him, without considering the impropriety
of her conduct. Here he drew his sword, and,
throwing himself at her feet, professed his
despair, and declared himself resolved to put
an immediate end to his life. She endeavored
to reason him into calmness; but in vain. He
was sensible, that, if he now relinquished her
to her father, he should lose her forever. His
apparent agony overcame her, and she gave
him her hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her father was almost distracted at her
elopement. He traced her steps, and, following
her to the house, condescended to soothe
her with parental kindness; and promised her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>pardon and continued affection, if she would
renounce her worthless lover, and return.
She confessed it was too late; that she was
his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Petrified with astonishment, he looked at
her, for some time, with speechless grief; and,
showing his arm, bound up with the wound
he had received, left her with every token of
anguish and indignation!</p>

<p class='c000'>“When the fever of passion had abated, a
returning sense of duty in Juliana, and, in the
captain, the fear of losing the property which
he sought, induced them to seek a reconciliation,
and make submissive efforts to obtain
it. But her father was too highly incensed to
grant it to him, on any terms; or to her, on
any other than the utter rejection of her unworthy
companion. These terms were not
complied with.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sorrow and vexation preyed so deeply
upon the mind of this afflicted parent, that
they brought on a rapid decline; and he died
without again seeing his undutiful and ruined
daughter. His estate was divided between
Juliana and her four brothers. Her portion
was received by her husband, and soon spent
in dissipation and excess. Having rioted on
the fortune of his wife, while she often pined
at home for want of the common necessaries
of life, he left her, to join his regiment, promising
remittances from time to time, for her
support. This promise, however, was but ill
performed; and she now feels the dreadful effects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of her folly, in the accumulated ills of
poverty and neglect. Yet she still cherishes
the most passionate fondness for what has
proved her bane. A friend called to see her,
not long since, and found her the emblem of
wretchedness and sloth. Her emaciated form,
her squalid appearance, the disorder of her
house, and her tattered raiment, bespoke the
shameful negligence of the owner. Yet she
was sitting with a novel in her hand, over
which she had apparently been weeping. She
expatiated largely on the tale it contained, while
her children, who exhibited a picture of real
woe, engaged not her attention. Her friend
enquired how she could be thus interested
and distressed by mere fiction, while every
thing about her was calculated to arouse the
keenest feelings of her soul! She coolly replied,
I have fortitude sufficient to support my
own calamity, but I must sympathize with the
heroine of adversity. I have not lost my
sensibility with my fortune. My only luxury
is now imagination! How ill-timed, and how
improperly exerted, was this kind of sensibility,
in Juliana! Where, and what was her
sensibility, when she disobeyed an indulgent
parent, sacrificed her reputation, and threw
herself into the arms of a worthless man for
protection—from what? from the kindness and
love of her best friends!</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I would not be understood to condemn
all novels indiscriminately; though great
prudence is necessary to make a useful selection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Some of them are fraught with sentiment;
convey lessons for moral improvement;
and exhibit striking pictures of virtue rewarded;
and of vice, folly, and indiscretion punished;
which may prove encouragements to
imitate, or warnings to avoid similar practices.
I shall not descend to particulars. Those,
which are sanctioned by the general voice of
delicacy and refinement, may be allowed a
reading; yet none should engross your minds,
to the neglect of more important objects; nor
be suffered to monopolize too large a portion
of your time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Novels are a kind of light reading, on
which the imagination feasts, while the more
substantial food which is requisite to the nourishment
of the understanding, is either untasted
or undigested. Imagination is a sportive
faculty, which should be curbed by the
reins of prudence and judgment. Its sallies
are delightful in youth, provided they be not
too excursive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poetry is, by some, ranked with novels;
but I think injudiciously. Good poetry is
certainly a sublime source of entertainment
and instruction. What music is to the ear,
poetry is to the heart. There must, indeed,
be a natural taste for it, before it can be highly
relished or enjoyed; and this taste, whereever
it exists, should be cultivated. I know
of no kind of reading more richly formed for
the mental repast of a liberal and polished
young lady, than the poetical productions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>true genius. The trifling and indelicate cantos
of ordinary witlings, and every day poetasters,
are unworthy your attention. But the
species of poetry which I now recommend, is
peculiarly adapted to soften the passions, excite
sympathy, and meliorate the affections.
It soothes the jarring cares of life, and, pervading
the secret recesses of the soul, serves
to rouse and animate its dormant powers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many essays, written by monitors of both
sexes, are extant, which you may find profitable
and pleasing, both in youth and more advanced
age. Among the foremost of these,
I mention Mrs. Chapone’s letters to her niece,
which contain a valuable treasure of information
and advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But among your hours devoted to reading,
history must not be without a place.
Here an extensive field of ages and generations,
which have gone before you, is opened
to your view. Here your curiosity may be
gratified by a retrospection of events, which,
by conducting your thoughts to remotest
climes and periods, interests and enlarges the
mind. Here the various revolutions, the rise,
fall, and dismemberment of ancient kingdoms
and states may be traced to the different
springs of action, in which they originated.
Hence you may gain a competent
acquaintance with human nature in all its modifications,
from the most rude and barbarous,
to the most civilized and polished stages of
society. This is a species of knowledge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>which will not only be of constant use to you,
in the government of your own temper and
manners, but highly ornamental in your intercourse
with the polite and learned world.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But let your reading of every description
be regular and methodical. Never confuse
your minds by a variety of subjects at once.
When you turn your attention to any one in
particular, finish, and lay that aside, before
you take up another. Let what you read be
well understood at the time, and well digested
afterwards. Possess yourselves, at least, of the
leading traits: otherwise your labor will be
totally lost. If convenient, always recapitulate
what you have been perusing, and annex
to it your own sentiments and remarks, to
some friend. If you have no friend at hand,
who will be disposed to hear, recollect, and
run it over in your own thoughts. This will
be a great assistance to memory. But whatever
be the kind of reading which you undertake,
select such authors as good judges esteem
the best, upon the subject. Have a
particular regard to the morality and delicacy
of the books you peruse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When you read for mere amusement,
(which should seldom happen) be careful not
to corrupt and vitiate your taste by frothy and
illiberal performances, which will degrade the
dignity and sully the purity of your minds.
That time is very greatly misspent, which is
bestowed in reading what can yield no instruction.
Not a moment’s attention should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>given to books which afford not some degree
of improvement. Always have an eye, therefore,
to profit, as well as to pleasure. Remember
that youth is the seed-time of life.
You are now to cultivate that knowledge,
which future years must ripen. Free from
those domestic cares, which will engross and
occupy your minds, when placed at the head
of families, a most inestimable price is now
put into your hands to get wisdom. Now you
may learn; then you must practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, therefore, lay up in store some provision
for every exigence, some embellishment
for every station.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look upon Elvira. Her acquirements in
a single state have qualified her for a shining
pattern of matronal duties. Her husband’s
business abroad prevents him from attending
to domestic avocations; nor need he be anxious
respecting the management of his household
affairs. Elvira is present to every occasion.
The superintendence of her family,
and the education of her children is her delight.
Capable of instructing them in every
needful branch of science, and of furnishing
them with every requisite endowment, she is,
at once, their guide, their example, and their
friend. When her husband returns from the
cares and fatigues of business, with what becoming
ease and cheerfulness does she dissipate
the anxiety which sometimes hangs upon
his brow, and exhilarate his spirits by the enlivening
charms of rational and refined conversation!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>In the entertainment of their
friends, how distinguished a part she sustains!
Her powers of mind have been so happily improved,
that she is able to discuss every subject
with ease and propriety. To an enlarged
understanding and a cultivated taste, to an extensive
knowledge of the world and an acquaintance
with polite literature, she superadds
those amiable virtues, which give society its
highest relish; while the elegance of her manners
and the modesty of her deportment are a
proof of the greatness of her mind, and render
her esteemed, beloved, and respected by all
who know her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I flatter myself that each of you, my
dear pupils, will be an Elvira. Then will you do
justice to the superior advantages of your education;
be the delight of your friends, and the
ornaments of your country.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Religious subjects must, by no means, be
neglected in the course of your reading. Let
the BIBLE be the rule of your faith and practice.
If you wish an explanation of any particular
passages, seek it from some judicious
and pious friend, or in the writings of some
judicious and learned commentator. But
always attend chiefly to those points which
serve to mend the heart, rather than to those
knotty, metaphysical disquisitions, which tend
only to perplex the understanding, and involve
the inquirer in such labyrinths of abstrusity,
as are above human comprehension, and beyond
human concern. The essential doctrines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and precepts of the gospel are level to
every capacity; and upon a life and conversation
governed by these, our hopes, both of
present peace and future glory, must be founded.
“He hath shewed thee what is good;
and what doth the Lord require of thee, but
to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WRITING AND ARITHMETIC.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The young ladies being seated, this morning,
their preceptress addressed them as follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Writing is productive both of pleasure
and improvement. It is a source of entertainment
which enlarges the mental powers
more, perhaps, than any other. The mind is
obliged to exertion for materials to supply the
pen. Hence it collects new stores of knowledge,
and is enriched by its own labors. It
imperceptibly treasures up the ideas, which
the hand impresses. An opportunity is furnished
of reviewing our sentiments before
they are exposed; and we have the privilege
of correcting or expunging such as are erroneous.
For this purpose, you will find it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>good method to collect and write your thoughts
upon any subject that occurs; for by repeatedly
arranging and revising your expressions
and opinions, you may daily improve them,
and learn to think and reason properly on
every occasion. By this mean you may likewise
provide yourselves with a fund of matter
for future use, which, without this assistance,
the memory would not retain. It will be of
great service to note down in your commonplace
book such particulars as you may judge
worth remembering, with your own observations
upon them. This will be a kind of
amusement which will exercise your thinking
powers at the time, and by recurring to it afterwards,
it may afford you many useful hints.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The frequent use of the pen is calculated
to refine and enlarge your understandings.
Have you any talent at composition? it will
be increased by cultivation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neglect no opportunity, therefore, which
your leisure affords, of delighting your friends,
and accomplishing yourselves by the exercise
of your genius in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thrice blessed are we, the happy daughters
of this land of liberty, where the female
mind is unshackled by the restraints of tyrannical
custom, which in many other regions
confines the exertions of genius to the usurped
powers of lordly man! Here virtue, merit,
and abilities are properly estimated under
whatever form they appear. Here the widely
extended fields of literature court attention;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and the American fair are invited to cull the
flowers, and cultivate the expanding laurel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the species of writing, which is open
to every capacity, and ornamental to every
station, is the epistolary. This, between particular
friends, is highly agreeable and interesting.
It is a method of interchanging sentiments,
and of enjoying intercourse with those
from whom you are far removed, which is a
happy substitute for personal conversation.
In a correspondence of this sort, all affectation,
formality, and bombast should be laid
aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ease, frankness, simplicity, and sincerity
should be its leading traits. Yet let not your
letters be composed of mere sounding terms,
and verbose egotism; but intermix sentiment
with expression, in such a manner as may be
improving as well as pleasing. Letters of
friendship should conduce no less to the advantage
than entertainment of the person addressed;
and mere cursory letters, of general
acquaintance, must, at least, be written with
propriety and accuracy. The formation of
the characters, the spelling, the punctuation,
as well as the style and sense, must be attended
to.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never omit noticing the receipt of letters,
unless you mean to affront the writers. Not
to answer a letter, without being able to assign
some special reason for the neglect is
equally unpardonable as to keep silence when
conversation is addressed to you in person.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“By habituating yourselves to writing, what
may, at first, appear a task, will become extremely
pleasant. Refuse not, then, to improve
this part of your education, especially
by your frequent and dutifully affectionate
epistles to your parents, when absent from
them. Express your gratitude for their care,
and convince them it has not been lost upon
you.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Always employ your pens upon something
useful and refined. Let no light or loose
compositions occupy your time and thoughts;
but remember that what you utter in this way
is in some measure the picture of your hearts.
Virtue forbid, that this favorite employment
should be disgraced by impurity, indelicacy,
or the communication of vicious and ignoble
sentiments!</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of the sages of antiquity being asked
why he was so long in writing his opinion, replied,
‘I am writing for futurity.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your characters during life, and even
when you shall sleep in the dust, may rest on
the efforts of your pens. Beware then how
you employ them. Let not the merit of your
attainments in this noble art be degraded by
improper subjects for its exercise. Suffer not
the expectation of secresy to induce you to
indulge your pens upon subjects, which you
would blush to have exposed. In this way
your characters may be injured, and your happiness
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Celia and Cecilia were companions at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>boarding school. When separated, they commenced
an epistolary correspondence, on
which each valued herself. Their former intimacy
which they termed friendship, prompted
them to write with unlimited confidence;
and, without the least reserve, to reveal every
dictate of levity and thoughtless folly. They
imagined themselves perfectly secure from the
censure of the critic. Their education had
not taught them, that a virtuous mind should
shrink even from ideal indelicacy. Celia was
courted by Silvander, a young man of whom
she was passionately fond; but she had art
and resolution enough to conceal her letters
from his inspection, though he often solicited
a communication of her correspondence. At
length he became impatient for a perusal of
letters which appeared so pleasing and interesting
to the parties, and suspicious that some
particular cause directed their privacy. Influenced
by these motives, Silvander bribed a
market-boy, who came from the village where
Cecilia lived, and always conveyed the letters
to and from her, to give them first into his
hand. How astonished was he to find the
lightness of mind exemplified in them! Purity
of sentiment, delicacy of thought, and refinement
of taste were entirely laid aside; and
illiberal wit, frothy jests, double entendres,
and ridiculous love-tales were substituted in
their place. His name was used with so much
freedom, and every circumstance relative to
his intercourse, and proposed connexion with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Celia, was bandied with such familiarity, that
he was mortified, disgusted, and chagrined,
in the extreme. He had the policy, however,
to conceal the discovery till he had copied a
considerable number of Celia’s letters, leaving
out whatever had reference to his own affairs.
He then revenged himself by disclosing his
knowledge to her, avowing his indignation at
her weakness, duplicity and folly, and taking
an immediate and final leave. Not content
with this, he even circulated her letters among
his acquaintance. This fixed the stamp of
ignominy on the correspondents; and their
names and characters were rendered as ridiculous
as scandal and malicious wit could desire.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Celia was almost distracted at the loss of
her lover; but when she found the method he
had taken to punish her indiscretion, and that
her reputation was thus materially injured, she
secluded herself, in a great measure, from
society. Her sensibility received a wound
which could never be healed; and she lived
and died in melancholy, regret, and obscurity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“However censurable the unjust and ungenerous
conduct of Silvander may be deemed,
yet no adequate excuse can be offered for
the young ladies, who dishonored their pens
and their talents by a most improper and unbecoming
use of both.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Next to writing, arithmetic usually claims
attention. This is absolutely necessary in
every department, and in every stage of life</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Even in youth, the proper arrangement of
your expenses will conduce greatly to your
advantage; and when placed at the head of
families, it will be very friendly to the order
and economy of your domestic affairs. But,
leaving your matronal conduct to future admonition,
many benefits result from keeping
regular accounts in a single state. Your parents
allow you a certain sum for your own
private use. Fashion and folly are always
busy in creating innumerable imaginary wants,
which must exceed your finances, if you do
not attend to an exact adjustment of your expenditures.
For this purpose, always calculate
your immediate and most necessary demands.
Let these be first supplied, and then
if your funds be not exhausted, more superfluous
ones may occupy your thoughts. There
is one claim, however, which must not be neglected,
and that is <span class='fss'>CHARITY</span>. You will, therefore,
manage your expenses in such a manner
as to reserve some portion of your income for
the necessitous. Should you think your allowance
insufficient to admit the children of
want to a share, let your benevolence plead
for the retrenchment of some trifling article
which you may dispense with, without much
inconvenience; and the exquisite pleasure resulting
from the bestowment, will more than
counterbalance the sacrifice. In these, and
many other particulars, a knowledge of arithmetic
will enable you to conduct the affairs of
youth with ease, advantage, and usefulness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>And, perhaps, as you advance in years, and
are called to fill more important stations, you
may find it of still greater utility.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The father of Lucinda was in easy circumstances,
while he could perform the duties
and enjoy the profits of a lucrative business.
He was the affectionate parent of a
numerous family, to whose education and improvement
he attended with unwearied diligence
and pleasure; till repeated losses in
trade, and disappointments in his worldly expectations
embarrassed his affairs, depressed
his spirits, and impaired his health. In the
midst of these difficulties, his amiable and beloved
wife was removed by death. This trial
was greater than he could support. He sunk
under the affliction, and lost his reason. Lucinda
was the eldest of six children, the care
of whom, with the melancholy task of attending
and ministering to the necessities of her
unhappy father, devolved on her. She looked
upon the wo-fraught scene, and wept. Her
heart was sinking under the weight of grief;
and hope, the best soother of the unfortunate,
had nearly abandoned her. She advised with
her friends, who proposed to relieve the family
by means of a subscription. Lucinda thanked
them for their proffered kindness, and returned
to her disconsolate habitation. She deliberated
on the projected measure; which she considered
must be slow, uncertain, and, at any
rate, inadequate to their future exigences.
She could not reconcile herself to the idea of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>her father’s depending on charity for subsistence.
Yet what could be done? One resource
only remained;—her own exertions. By these
she flattered herself, that she might save the
family from suffering want, and discharge the
obligations she owed to her revered parent.
Her education, by which, among other branches
of learning, she had been well instructed in
arithmetic, (that being her father’s favorite
study) qualified her for this undertaking. She
therefore devoted herself to the business
without delay; examined her father’s accounts,
collected whatever remained that was valuable;
sold the superfluous moveables, and purchased
a small stock for trade. All who knew
her motives and merit frequented her shop,
and encouraged her by their custom and kindness.
By this mean, together with her judicious
management, and engaging behavior,
she increased her business to such a degree,
as to support the family with ease and reputation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her discreet and dutiful conduct to her
father, soon restored him to his reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When he found how prudently and affectionately
Lucinda had exerted herself in his
behalf, he exclaimed, ‘Many daughters have
done virtuously, but thou excellest them all!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“He resumed his former business, and lived
to see his children all well provided for, and
happily settled around him.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>MUSIC AND DANCING.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Her pupils having taken their places, Mrs.
Williams proceeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In music and dancing you have made such
proficiency that your performances must be
very pleasing to your friends, before whom
you occasionally exhibit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As dancing is an accomplishment merely
external, let not the vanity of excellence in
it betray itself in an air of conscious superiority,
when you shine at the ball, and perceive
yourselves to have attracted the attention
and applause of the gay assembly. But
in the midst of hilarity and mirth, remember
that modesty, diffidence, discretion, and humility
are indispensable appendages of virtue
and decency.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Music is a talent which nature has bestowed,
and which your application has considerably
improved. It has a powerful influence
over the heart; wonderfully soothes and humanizes
the passions, and is a source of refined
pleasure to a mind capable of tasting its
charms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never refuse gratifying your friends by
the exertion of your abilities in performing,
unless for some very special reason. Though
I would not have you vain of your skill, and
officiously forward to display it; yet the affectation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of uncommon modesty, and ignorance,
is truly ridiculous. To plead inability to exercise
powers, which you are conscious of possessing,
and for which you wish to be esteemed
and honored by others, is false delicacy,
and will never gain admission to the breast
where that which is genuine resides. How
perfectly absurd it is for a young lady, who
is politely requested to entertain a company
with her musical talents, to declare them so
small that she is really ashamed to expose
herself before such good judges; or that she
has neglected playing, or singing, for some
time, and cannot immediately revive her dormant
skill; or that she has forgotten her
tunes, or songs; or that she has a bad
cold; (which none but herself perceives,) and
is unable to sing; or that she is loath to
begin this amusement, and must insist upon
some other lady’s setting the example;
which other lady has, in her turn, an equal
number of excuses! Thus the time of the
company is engrossed, and their pleasure
suspended, till a long train of arguments,
entreaties, and compliments are run through,
and her vanity fully gratified by the most flattering
and importunate solicitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then, elate with pride and self importance,
she condescends to grant their request; not
considering how far she has derogated from
her own merit by the futile artifice she has
employed; an artifice unworthy of an ingenuous
mind, and disgraceful to any lady who has
arrived to years of discretion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Let us view this evasive manner of seeking
compliments a little nearer. When a person
is known to be mistress of this delightful
art, what can be her motive for delaying the
gratification of her friends by its exercise, and
refusing a compliance with their wishes, till
their patience is exhausted? I believe that
excuses, in this case, are very seldom sincere.
The youthful mind is not insensible to praise,
nor indifferent to the means of obtaining it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why then should it not be received and
increased by a ready and obliging compliance?
A desire to please is usually attended with
success; and for what reason should the power
and disposition be artfully concealed?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Always preserve a frankness and sincerity
in your actions and designs. These will add
dignity to your condescensions, and gracefulness
to your deportment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rise superior to those little arts which
bespeak the finesse of a childish folly, or a
narrow mind. Do honor to this, as well as to
every other part of your education, by acting
conformably to the precepts which have been
given you, the knowledge which you have
acquired, and the opportunities with which
you may be furnished for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Music and dancing, though polite and
elegant accomplishments, are, perhaps, the
most fascinating, and, of course, the most dangerous
of any that fall under that description.
When indulged to excess, beside engrossing
much time which ought to be employed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>execution of more necessary and useful designs,
they sometimes allure their fond votaries
from that purity and rectitude which are
the chief embellishments of the female character.
They lay the mind open to many
temptations, and, by nourishing a frivolous
vanity, benumb the nobler powers both of reflection
and action.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Levitia was endowed, by the joint influence
of nature and art, with these pleasing
charms. Symmetry was perfected in her form;
and her voice was melody itself. Her parents
were not in affluent circumstances; yet their
taste led them to distinguish those graces and
talents in their daughter, which they injudiciously
flattered themselves might, one day,
raise her to affluence and fame. Hence they
spared no pains nor expense, in their power
to bestow, to assist her inclination and gratify
her wishes. As she advanced in years, she
assiduously cultivated and diligently improved
those endowments which she had been erroneously
encouraged, and even taught, to consider
most valuable. To adorn her person, regulate
her movements, and practise her music,
was all her care. Nor had she a wish beyond
the pleasures, which she fancied they could
yield. Her mind resembled a garden, in
which the useful plants were overrun and
choked by noxious weeds. Here and there,
a gaudy flower rears its brilliant head, and
proudly dares to arrest the eye; while the
delicate and useful lie buried and concealed in
the surrounding waste!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Flattery was pleasing to her ear, in whatever
form it was presented. The gay and
licentious sought her society; and vanity with
its attendant train of follies led her imagination
far from the sphere of life which Providence
had assigned her. Her parents saw
their own mistake, and were alarmed at her’s:
but, alas! too late were their endeavors to
prevent the mischiefs which impended. They
could not supply her unbounded wants; and
therefore to gratify her ruling passion, she
deemed means of her own invention indispensable.
Among her admirers was a foreigner,
who, failing of success in his own country,
sought a subsistence in ours, from the stage.
He knew Levitia’s talents. These might
give her the palm of applause, and in his way
of life, render her conspicuous. This plan
he communicated to her, insidiously offering
to become her guardian, and to put her under
the protection of such friends as should defend
her honor, and ensure her success. She
was pleased with the project. Wholly unacquainted
with the world, and unsuspicious
of the subtle arts of the deluding libertine,
she scrupled not his veracity, but listened to
his insinuating declarations of love and friendship.
She was deceived by the vanity of appearing
where her fancied merit would meet
with the encouragement and reward it deserved;
and vainly imagining that her beauty
might secure her elevation and affluence, she
readily consented to the fatal experiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>eloped from her father’s house, and became
a professed actress.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her parents were overwhelmed with grief
and anxiety, at the discovery; but to no purpose
were all their exertions to reclaim her.
She had left them, no more to return; left
them, too, with the heart-rending reflection,
that they themselves had heedlessly contributed
to her disgrace and ruin. But bitter indeed
were the fruits of her disobedience and
folly!</p>

<p class='c000'>“She made her appearance on the stage.
She sung and danced, for which she was caressed,
flattered, and paid. A licentious mode
of life quadrating with the levity of her heart,
soon left her a prey to seduction. Her gaiety
and beauty gained her many votaries, and she
became a complete courtezan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the midst of this career, her mother
died of a broken heart, evidently occasioned
by her undutiful and vicious conduct. A
sense of her ingratitude to her parents, and
her shameless manner of life struck her mind,
not naturally unfeeling, with such force, as to
throw her into a fever which undermined her
constitution, deprived her of her beauty, ruined
her voice, and left her without means of
support. Her pretended lover, finding she
could no longer be useful to him, perfidiously
abandoned her to poverty and shame. She
returned, like the prodigal, to her unhappy
father, who received, but could not assist
her. Her behavior, with its consequences in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the death of her mother, had impaired his
health, depressed his spirits, and rendered him
incapable of providing for himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is now despised and avoided by all
her former acquaintance, and must inevitably
spend the remainder of her days in wretchedness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us turn from this disgusting picture,
and behold its contrast in the amiable Florella.
To beauty of person she superadds delicacy,
sensibility, and every noble quality of the
mind. Respectful to her superiors, affable,
cheerful, and polite to her equals, and condescendingly
kind to her inferiors, Florella is
universally esteemed, beloved and admired.
Of the pleasing accomplishments of music
and dancing she is a consummate mistress.
Yet she is superior to the vain arts of flattery,
while the dignity of conscious virtue raises
her far above the affectation of false modesty
and diffidence. To please and oblige those
friends who are interested in her happiness,
and gratified by her performances, is her delight.
Nor does she think it necessary, by
feigned excuses, to delay the pleasure, which
she is able to afford; but willingly enhances
that pleasure by a ready and cheerful compliance.
This she thinks the best return she
can make for their kind attention. Though
delighted with these amusements herself, she,
nevertheless, considers them as amusements
only; and assiduously cultivates the more solid
branches of her education. These, she is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>wont to say, may render me useful and happy,
when the voice of music shall be brought
low, and when the sprightly limbs shall become
languid and inactive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How happy her parents in her filial duty
and affection! How rich the reward of their
care and expense in contributing to her improvements!
How happy Florella in their
complacency and love, and in the consciousness
of deserving them!</p>

<p class='c000'>“She was, not long since, addressed by a
gentleman, who was pleasing to her fancy;
but, determined never to indulge a sentiment
of partiality without the entire approbation of
her parents, she referred him to their decision.
For particular reasons, they disapproved of
his suit. She acquiesced without reserve,
and immediately dismissed him. Who would
not rather be a resembler of Florella, than a
vain, imprudent, and ruined Levitia?</p>

<p class='c000'>“True, indeed, the acquirements and graces
of Florella are not attainable by every
one; but the virtues of discretion, modesty,
and kindness are within the reach of the humblest
sphere, and the most moderate abilities.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>MISCELLANEOUS DIRECTIONS<br /> <span class='large'>FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE TEMPER AND MANNERS.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>“I shall now,” said Mrs. Williams, “endeavor
to sketch out for you the plan of conduct,
which I think will be most conducive to
your honor and happiness while in a single state.
Hitherto you have been under the direction
of parents, guardians, and instructors, who
have regulated your deportment, and labored
to give you just ideas upon every subject and
occasion. That period is now over. You
are now launching into life; where you will
think and act more for yourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The path of rectitude, my dear young
friends, is narrow and intricate. Temptations
lurk around to beguile your feet astray; and
dangers which appear insurmountable will
often arise to affright you from the ways of
virtue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But remember that a crown of honor and
happiness awaits the undeviating pursuit of
truth and duty. Let religion be your guide,
and discretion your handmaid. Thus attended,
you will escape the snares of youth, and surmount
the perplexing cares of more advanced
age. At your entrance on the stage of action,
the allurements of pleasure will spread innumerable
charms to court your acceptance.
Beware of their fascinating wiles; and whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>course you adopt, be sure it is such as
will bear the test of examination and reflection.
Let these be the criterion of all your
pursuits and enjoyments. Make it an invariable
 practice to re-trace the actions and occurrences
of the day, when you retire to rest;
to account with your own hearts for the use
and improvement of the past hours; and rectify
whatever you find amiss, by greater vigilance
and caution, in future; to avoid the
errors into which you have fallen, and to discharge
the duties incumbent upon you.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To neglect this, will be a source of great
inadvertencies and failings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To know yourselves, in every particular,
must be your constant endeavor. This knowledge
will lead you to propriety and consistency
of action. But this knowledge cannot be obtained
without a thorough and repeated inspection
of your various passions, affections, and
propensities. When obtained, however, it
will prevent the ill effects of flattery, by which
you will doubtless be endangered, as you advance
into the scenes of fashionable life. It
will enable you to distinguish flattery from
that generous praise which is the effusion of
a feeling heart, affected by the perception of
real merit. A young lady, unskilled in the
deceitful arts of a giddy world, is very apt to
be misled by the adulation which is offered at
the shrine of vanity. She is considered as a
mark for the wit of every coxcomb, who wishes
to display his gallantry.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Flattery is a dazzling meteor, which casts
a delusive glare before the eye; and which
seduces the imagination, perverts the judgment,
and silences the dictates of sound reason.
Flattery is, therefore, the poison and
bane of the youthful mind. It renders the
receiver blind to those defects which she ought
to see and rectify, and proud of imaginary
graces which she never yet possessed. Self-knowledge,
as before observed, will facilitate
the detection of this disguised adversary, by
enabling you to investigate your real accomplishments
and merits.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That praise which is the result of deserved
approbation from those, whose good opinion
you wish to enjoy, is worthy your attention
and grateful acceptance: but the fulsome
compliments and hyperbolical professions
of unmeaning and empty pretenders, calculated
only to fill the imagination with the inflammable
air of self-conceit and arrogant
pride, should be rejected with disdain, and
cordially despised by every lady of sense and
sentiment, as an insult upon her understanding,
and an indignity to her sensibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let it, therefore, be known to those who
court your favor by an ostentatious parade
of admiration and obsequiousness, that their
dissimulation and duplicity are discovered, and
that you are superior to such futility.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In order to discriminate between flattery
and merited praise, critically examine your
own heart and life. By this mean you will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>ascertain what is really your due, and what
is merely the effect of this insidious art. But
let no ideas of your own endowments, however
just, elate you with an opinion of your
superior powers of pleasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be not ostentatious of your charms, either
of person or mind. Let modesty, diffidence,
and propriety regulate you, in regard to each.
Exalted advantages will render you an object
of envy to the weak minded of your own
sex, and of satire to the ill-natured part of the
other. Never obtrude even your real graces
and accomplishments upon the world. The
penetrating and judicious will see and applaud
them, while retiring from the gaze of a misjudging
and misrepresenting throng.</p>

      <div class='line'>But yield her charms of mind with sweet delay.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Those who are solicitous for beauty should
remember that the expression of the countenance,
in which its very essence consists, depends
on the disposition of the mind.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Some, none resist, tho’ not exceeding fair.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Beauty, my dear girls, is indeed a desirable
quality. Neither the pen of the moralist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>nor the spleen of the satirist, nor the envy
of such as want it, could ever bring it into
contempt or neglect. Yet mere external
beauty is transient as the meteor, and frail as
the bubble, which floats on the surface of the
watery element.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Behold the disconsolate and despised
Flirtilla! and from her fate learn not to trust
in the effects or duration of this adventitious
quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Early in life, Flirtilla was taught that her
charms were irresistible; that she might aspire
to an absolute ascendency over the hearts
and passions of her votaries. A superficial,
but fashionable education added the allurements
of art to those of person, and rendered
her a finished coquette.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her beauty and the gaiety of her manners
gained her numerous admirers, who swarmed
around, like the insect tribe, eager to sip the
fragrance of the equally fair and fading rose.
The incense of flattery, in every form, was
her tribute.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Elated by this, she gave free scope to
her ruling passions, the love of pleasure and
dissipation. Her best days were spent in the
chase of vanity; and she culled the flowers of
life, without considering, that substantial fruit
would be required at a more advanced period,
as a substitute for the fading blossoms of
youth. Her mind was barren of improvement,
and consequently destitute of resources.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She vainly imagined the triumphs of beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to be permanent, till its declared enemy,
the small-pox, convinced her of the egregious
mistake. By this she found her empire suddenly
overturned. The merciless disorder
had reduced her to a level with the generality
of her sex, in appearance, and, in enjoyment
far below them. Her glass faithfully represented
this insupportable reduction. Regret
and chagrin heightened the apparent calamity.
She was remembered only as the contrast
of what she once had been. Her lovers
were disgusted with the change, and sought
more pleasing objects of attention; while men
of sentiment could not find a similarity of disposition,
in her, to induce a connexion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her female acquaintance, who had envied
her as a rival, or feared her as a superior,
now insulted her with their pity, or mortified
her by remarks on the surprising alteration
in her appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Finding no alleviation from society, she
retired from the world to nurse, in solitude,
the vexation and disappointment she experienced.</p>

<p class='c000'>“View her now, peevish, discontented, and
gloomy! Her ideas of pleasure were centered
in that person, which is now neglected; in
those endowments which have now forsaken
her forever!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thought she studiously shuns; for she
has nothing pleasing to occupy her reflections,
but what is irretrievably lost!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miserable Flirtilla! thou trustedst in vanity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and vanity is thy recompense! How
happy mightest thou have been, even in this
change, if thy heart had been rectified, thy
understanding improved, and thy mind liberally
stored with useful sentiments, knowledge,
and information!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cultivate, then, my young friends, those
dispositions and attainments, which will yield
permanent and real satisfaction, when sickness,
adversity, or age shall have robbed your
eyes of their lustre, and diminished the bloom
and sprightliness of your forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are doubtless sensible that your happiness,
in life, does not depend so much on
your external, as your internal graces.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The constitutional temper of your minds
was given you by nature; but reason is added
for its regulation.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Our passions were certainly implanted
for wise and benevolent purposes; and, if
properly directed, may be of great utility.
This direction nature will teach, and education
improve. To their precepts we must
implicitly listen, if we would become respectable
or contented.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Examine yourselves, therefore, with impartial
scrutiny. Find out your particular
faults in this respect, and exert your unwearied
industry to amend them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Possibly you may be naturally hasty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>passionate, or vindictive. If so, how wretched,
at times, must the indulgence of this temper
render you! When reason, awhile suspended,
resumes its empire, and calm reflection
succeeds the riot of passion, how severe must
be your self-condemnation, and how keen
your sensations of regret! Perhaps an unkindness
of expression to some particular
friend, disrespectful treatment of an honored
superior, ill-timed resentment to a beloved
equal, or imperious and unbecoming severity
to a deserving inferior, may give you the most
painful emotions, and degrade you in your
own, as well as in the estimation of every observer!
To prevent this evil, accustom yourselves
to check the first risings of anger, and
suspend every expression of displeasure, till
you can deliberate on the provocation, and
the propriety of noticing it. It may have
been undesigned, and, therefore, not justly
provoking. You may have misunderstood the
word, or action of offence, and inquiry may
remove the grounds of your suspicion: or
the person offending may be one with whom
prudence and honor require you not to enter
the lists. But if neither of these considerations
occur, reflect a moment, that your own reputation
and consequent happiness are at stake
and that to lose the command of yourselves
and your passions is inconsistent with the delicacy
of ladies, the moderation of Christians,
and the dignity of rational beings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let every sally alarm, and excite you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>rally and new-discipline your forces; and to
be more strictly on your guard against the
assaults of your foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The character of Camilla is a pattern
worthy of your imitation. While very young,
Camilla was unfortunately deprived of the instruction
and regulating hand of a discreet and
judicious mother. Her father was too much
immersed in business to attend to the cultivation
of his daughter’s mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He gave her the means of a genteel education,
praised her excellencies, and chid her
faults, without being at the pains of teaching
her how to amend them. The irritability of
her temper he rather indulged, considering her
as a girl of <em>spirit</em>, who would make her way
in the world, in spite of obstacles. She was
naturally generous, tender-hearted, and humane;
but her temper was as uncontrollable
as the whirlpool, and as impetuous as the
wind. Happily for her, she had an uncommon
strength of mind, a ready apprehension,
a quick perception, and a depth of understanding,
seldom equalled. She saw her errors,
was conscious of her failings, and a severe sufferer
for her faults. But such was the extreme
quickness of her feelings, and so passionate
her resentment of any thing which
appeared injurious or affrontive, that she
could not always repress them. She married
a gentleman of a similar temper, and of equal
prudence. In the union of such violent spirits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>great harmony could not be presaged. Their
passions were lively, their affections ardent.</p>

diligence; to suppress every emotion of
anger; and when she thought herself injured,
to retire or be silent, till passion had subsided,

the bane of social love. It is an evidence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a weak and sickly mind. True greatness will
rise superior to this ignoble spirit, so peculiarly
ungraceful in a lady, and inconsistent with
that delicacy and softness, which ought ever
to characterize the sex.</p>

the most degrading and miserable. Envy is
a malignant poison, which rankles in the heart,

<h3 class='c008'>DRESS.</h3>

<p class='c009'>“Dress,” continued Mrs. Williams to her
re-assembled and attentive pupils, “is an important
article of female economy. By some
it is doubtless considered as too essential.
This is always the case, when it becomes the
ruling passion, and every other excellence is
made subordinate to it. A suitable attention
to the etiquette of appearance is necessary to
render us respectable in the eyes of the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and discovers an accommodating disposition,
which is, at once, engaging and useful in the
commerce of society. Females are taxed with
being peculiarly attached to, and captivated
by the glare of splendor and show. But I believe
superficial minds are not confined to sex.
Whatever form they actuate, to beautify and
adorn it will be the principal object.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A certain species of gaiety and airiness
is becoming in youth. Young ladies, therefore,
act perfectly in character, when, under
proper restraint, they indulge their taste in the
decoration of their persons. But they should
be especially careful that their taste be correct;
consistent with the modest delicacy
which is the glory and ornament of woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is laudable to follow fashions, so far as
they are governed by these rules; but whenever
they deviate, quit them with express disapprobation
and disgust. Any assumptions of
the masculine habit are unbecoming. Dress and
manners should be correspondent; and the engaging
softness and artless simplicity, which
grace my pupils, must be quite inconsistent
with the air and attire of the other sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A gaudy and fantastical mode of decoration
is by no means a recommendation. It bespeaks
a lightness of mind and a vanity of
disposition, against which a discreet and modest
girl should guard with the utmost vigilance.
Extravagance is a great error, even where
fortune will allow the means of supporting it.
Many are the claims which the children of affliction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and want have upon the superfluous
plenty of the rich. How much better expended
would some part of their redundance be, in
relieving the necessities of such, than in decorating
their own persons, with every ornament
which art can contrive to create expense!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neatness and propriety should be the
main objects; for loveliness needs no foreign
aid to give it a passport. Neatness is too often
connected with the idea of a prudish singularity;
but no gaudiness of apparel, no richness
of attire, no modishness of appearance can be
an equivalent for it. Propriety is that garb
which becomes our situation and circumstances
in life. There certainly ought to be a
difference between different ages and conditions,
in this respect. Many articles, ornamental
to Miss in her teens, would appear
absurd, fantastical, and ridiculous in maturer
years. Neither should the matronal robes,
and the close cap hide the natural ringlets, and
easy shapes of the blooming girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a very false taste which induces people
in dependent and narrow circumstances, to
imitate the expensive mode of dress which
might be very decent for those who move in a
higher sphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To endeavor to conceal indigence by the
affectation of extravagance, is committing a
great offence, both against ourselves, and the
community to which we belong. The means
of support should always be attended to. A
conformity to these will render you more respected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>for prudence, than a deviation for the
sake of show without substance, can make
you admired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Louisa and Clarinda are striking examples.
They were both the daughters of reputable
parents, whose situations in the world were
easy and comfortable, though not affluent.
They were able to give their children a good
education, but no other portion. Gay, volatile,
and ambitious, Louisa was the votary of fashion.
A superior in dress excited the keenest
sensations of envy in her bosom; and a rival
in appearance gave her unspeakable mortification.
Dissatisfied with her natural charms,
cosmetics and paints added to her expenses,
and betrayed her folly. She had many professed
admirers, who found her a willing dupe
to flattery, and who raised her vanity by praising
her excellent taste.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leander, a gentleman of liberal education,
superior merit, and handsome property,
cast his eye around for a companion to share
and enjoy these advantages with him. Louisa
caught his attention. The elegance of her
person, and splendor of her appearance,
charmed his imagination, and inspired the idea
of a fortune sufficient to support her expensive
style of living. He paid his addresses and
was received with the most flattering encouragement.
But how great was his disappointment,
when he discovered the smallness of her
resources, and the imprudence of her management!
This, said he to himself, will never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>do for me. Were my income far superior to
what it is, it would not be adequate to such unbounded
extravagance. Besides, where so
little economy is practised, while under parental
government, what must be the consequence
of that unlimited indulgence, which the confidence
due to a wife demands? Were I to
abridge her expenses, and endeavor to rectify
her fantastical taste, it would doubtless foment
dissension, discord, and animosity, which must
terminate in wretchedness. He resolved,
however, to try her real disposition, by gently
hinting his disapprobation of her gaiety. This
she resented; and a rupture, which ended in
a final separation, ensued. She found, too
late, the value of the man, whom she had
slighted; and ever after regretted that folly
which had irretrievably alienated his affections.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The modesty and neatness of Clarinda’s
garb next caught Leander’s eye. Conversing
with her on the subject of dress, the justness
of her sentiments gave him the highest ideas
of the rectitude and innocence of her mind.
A costly article was offered for her purchase;
but she refused it. It would not become me,
said she, nor any other person who has not an
affluent fortune. If I had a sufficiency to
buy it, I would procure something more simple
and necessary for myself; and the overplus
might render an object of distress contented
and happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet was Clarinda always elegantly neat;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>always genteelly fashionable. Frugality and
economy, free from profusion and extravagance,
enabled her to indulge her own taste
entirely; and while she enjoyed that, she repined
not at the fancied superiority of others.
Leander found her all he wished, in appearance;
all he hoped for, in reality. As their
tastes were correspondent, and their highest
aim, when united, to please each other, they
were not dependent on the breath of fashion
for their happiness. A compliance with its
forms did not elate their pride, nor a departure
from them, fill their hearts with peevishness
and discontent.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>POLITENESS.</h3>

<p class='c009'>“Still more important than your habit, is
your air and deportment. It is not sufficient
that these are pleasing to the eye of the superficial
observer. Your behavior and conversation
must be uniformly governed by the laws
of politeness, discretion, and decorum. Else
you will be disgusting to people of refinement;
and the judicious and discerning will discover
the weakness of your minds, notwithstanding
the showy ornaments, intended to conceal it
from public view.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Inattention in company is a breach of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>good manners. Indeed, it is a downright insult;
being neither more nor less, than declaring
that you have not the least respect for any
who are present. Either you do not value
their good opinion, or you have something
more important than their conversation to occupy
your minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You should always be attentive to those with
whom you are conversant, let their rank and
standing be what they may. Your superiors
will esteem you for your respectful treatment
of them; your equals will love you for your
kindness and familiarity; your inferiors will
respect you for your condescension and meekness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Attention in company will be advantageous
to yourselves. Like the industrious bee,
which sips honey from every plant, you may
derive some benefit or instruction from all
kinds of society. Some useful remark or information;
some sentiment which may allure you
to the practice of virtue, or deter you from a
vicious perpetration, may repay your labor, and
be serviceable through life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But should there be no other motive than
that of pleasing your associates, and rendering
them happy, by making yourselves agreeable,
it may be considered as a sufficient inducement
to the practice of this branch of
good-breeding. Many girls, in the thoughtless
levity of their hearts, divert themselves at
the expense of others; and, with the utmost
glee, point out any thing peculiar in the appearance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>words, or actions of some one in the
company, whom they select for a subject of
merriment and ridicule. This, by shrewd
looks, ironical gestures, or tittering whispers,
is kept up, to the great mortification of the
unhappy victim, and to the reproach and dishonor
of the offenders. Such conduct is a
breach, not only of the rules of common civility,
but of humanity; besides being directly repugnant
to the precept of doing to others as
we would that they should do to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be particularly careful, then, not to mortify,
or give pain to an inferior.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let the question, ‘who maketh thee to
differ?’ suppress every emotion of ridicule,
contempt, or neglect; and induce you to raise
and encourage depressed merit by your notice
and approbation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As far as propriety, delicacy, and virtue
will allow, conform to the taste, and participate
in the amusements and conversation of
the company into which you have fallen. If
they be disagreeable to you, avoid a supercilious
avowal of your dislike. This, instead of
reforming, would probably give them a disgust
to you, and perhaps subject you to affronts.
Yet where a disapprobating word or hint may
be seasonable, neglect not the opportunity of
contributing to their benefit and amendment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you conscious of superior advantages,
either mental or external, make no ostentatious
display of them. Vanity too often leads young
ladies to obtrude their acquirements on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>eyes of observers, inconsiderately apprehending
they may otherwise be unnoticed. Such
forwardness always subjects them to censure,
ridicule, and envy; the expressions of which
destroy that self-approbation which retiring
merit invariably enjoys. However, exert that
dignity of virtue which will render you independent
of caprice, calumny, and unprovoked
satire.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make no ungenerous, or ill-natured remarks
on the company, or on the individuals
of which it is composed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you dislike them, avoid them in future.
If you witness errors, faults, or improprieties,
conceal, or at least extenuate them, as much
as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make just allowances for those who may
differ from you in opinion; and be cautious
never to misrepresent, or circulate what appears
amiss to you, and must, if exposed, be
injurious to others. Charity hides a multitude
of faults. Certainly then, charity will never
aggravate nor create them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To give currency to a report, which tends
to the disadvantage and dishonor of another,
is defaming; and defamation is a species of
cruelty, which can never be expiated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of this the unhappy, though imprudent
Eudocia, is an exemplification.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eudocia was young, gay, and charming.
A levity of disposition, which the innocence of
her heart attempted not to restrain, sometimes
gave the tongue of slander pretence to aim its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>envenomed shafts at her character, and to misrepresent
her sprightliness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Independent in fortune; still more so in
mind, calumny gave her no pain, while she
was conscious of the rectitude of her intentions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leontine was a gentleman of property;
agreeable in his person and manners; of strict
honor, and extremely tenacious of it; but of a
severe and unforgiving temper. He paid his
addresses to Eudocia; was accepted, approved,
and beloved. Yet, though he had gained
her affections, he had not sufficient influence
to regulate her conduct, and repress her gaiety.
Her fondness for show and gallantry, in
some instances, induced her to countenance
the attentions, and receive the flattery, of men,
whose characters were exceptionable, in Leontine’s
estimation. He remonstrated against
her imprudence, and gave her his ideas of female
delicacy. She laughed at his gravity,
and rallied him on his implicit subjection to the
opinions of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Towards the close of a fine day, Eudocia
rambled along a retired road, to enjoy the
air. She was alone; but the hope of meeting
her beloved Leontine, whom she expected
that evening, imperceptibly led her beyond her
intended excursion. The rattling of a carriage
caused her to stop; and, thinking it to be
Leontine’s, she approached it before she perceived
her mistake. A gentleman of an elegant
appearance alighted and accosting her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>politely, expressed his surprise at finding her
so far from home without an attendant. She
found it was Florio, with whom she had a slight
acquaintance, having once met with him in
company. She frankly owned her motive for
walking thus far; and refused his invitation to
return in his carriage. He renewed his request;
and his importunity, seconded by her
fatigue, at last prevailed. At this moment
the detracting Lavina passed by. She saw
Eudocia, and with a sneering smile, wished
her a good night. Eudocia was unconscious
of fault, and therefore fearless of censure.
But the artful Florio, desirous of protracting
the pleasure of her company, took a circuitous
route, which considerably increased the
distance to her father’s house. However, he
conveyed her safely home, though not so soon
as she wished. She found that Leontine had
been there, and had gone to visit a friend; but
would soon return. Leontine was just seated
at his friend’s, when Lavina entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She told the circle, that Florio had just
passed her, and that he had company she little
expected to see with him. They inquired if
it was his former mistress? No, said she,
he discarded her some time ago, and if we
may judge by appearances, has chosen a new
one. Upon being asked who, she presumed
to name Eudocia. Every countenance expressed
surprise and regret. In Leontine,
rage and resentment were visibly depicted.
He rose, and stepping hastily to Lavina, told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>her he was a party concerned, and demanded
an explanation of what she had insinuated.
She perceived that she had given offence, and
endeavored to excuse herself; but he resolutely
told her that no evasions would avail;
that he insisted on the real truth of her scandalous
report. Finding him thus determined,
she related the simple fact of seeing Eudocia
in a carriage with Florio, who was a known
libertine, and accustomed to the society of
loose women. Leontine asked her how she
came to associate the ideas she had mentioned
with Eudocia’s name? She replied that the
lightness of her behavior had sometimes rendered
her censurable; and she thought this instance,
in particular, authorised suspicion.
Leontine could not deny that she was culpable
in appearance; yet made answer, that though
scandal might feast on the failings of virtue,
he believed Eudocia’s innocence much purer,
and her heart much better than her detractors’;
and taking his hat, he wished the company a
good evening, and left them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His passions were on fire. He could not
comprehend the mysterious conduct of Eudocia.
Her absence from home, at a time when
he expected her to receive him, and her being
seen at a distance in company with a professed
debauchee, were a labyrinth which he could
not explore. Though he doubted not Eudocia’s
honor, yet her folly and imprudence, in
subjecting her character to suspicion and reproach,
he thought unpardonable. His resentment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>determined him to break the proposed
connexion immediately; and, lest his love
should get the better of his resolution, he went
directly to the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As he could not command his temper, he
appeared extremely agitated, and angrily told
Eudocia that she had caused him great uneasiness;
and that he came to claim the satisfaction
of knowing, why she had avoided his
society, and made an assignation with a man
who had involved her in infamy? Eudocia
was astonished and justly offended at this address.
With all the dignity of conscious innocence,
she replied, that as yet he had no right
to challenge an account of her conduct; but
for her own sake, she would condescend to
give it. This she did by a faithful and undisguised
relation of facts. She then asked him
if he was satisfied. He answered, No. For,
said he, though you have cleared yourself of
guilt, in my apprehension, you will find it very
difficult to free your character from the blemish
it has received in the opinion of the world.
Saying this he told her, that however highly
he esteemed her, so opposite were their dispositions,
that they must often be at variance;
and so nice was his sense of honor, that his
wife like Cæsar’s must not only be virtuous,
but unsuspected. She rejoined, that his sentiments
were apparent; and if what he then
expressed were his opinion of her, it was best
they should part.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some further conversation passed; when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>promising to call, the next day, and satisfy her
parents, and wishing Eudocia all possible happiness
in life, he took his leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The impropriety of her conduct, and her
losing the affections of a man she too ardently
loved, together with the cruel treatment she
had just received from him, overwhelmed her
with grief, and produced the most violent emotions
of regret. She walked her room in all
the anguish of disappointed hope. Her parents
used every argument to soothe and console
her, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She yielded to their persuasions so far as
to retire to bed; but rest she found not; and
the morning presented her in a burning fever.
Leontine called in the course of the day; but
the friends of Eudocia refused to see him. An
account of her disorder had roused him to a
sense of his rashness, and he begged to be
admitted to her chamber; but this she utterly
denied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her fever left her; but the disease of her
mind was beyond the power of medicine. A
settled melancholy still remains; and she lives
the victim of calumniation!</p>

<p class='c000'>“To detract from the merit of others, beside
the want of politeness which it betrays, and
beside the injuries which it always occasions, is
extremely impolitic. It is to confess your inferiority,
and to acknowledge a wish not to rise
to greater respectability; but to bring down
those about you to your own level! Ill-natured
remarks are the genuine offspring of an envious
and grovelling mind.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Call yourselves to a severe account, therefore,
whenever you have been guilty of this
degrading offence; and always check the first
impulses towards it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Accustom yourselves to the exercise of
sincerity, benevolence and good humor, those
endearing virtues, which will render you beloved
and respected by all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To bestow your attention in company, upon
trifling singularities in the dress, person, or
manners of others, is spending your time to
little purpose. From such a practice you can
derive neither pleasure nor profit; but must
unavoidably subject yourselves to the imputation
of incivility and malice.”</p>

relish for those enjoyments, which being simple
and natural, are best calculated to promote
health, innocence, and social delight, is totally
lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is by no means amiss for youth to seek
relaxation from severer cares and labors, in a
participation of diversions, suited to their age,
sex, and station in life. But there is great
danger of their lively imaginations’ hurrying
them into excess, and detaching their affections
from the ennobling acquisitions of moral improvement,
and refined delicacy. Guard, then
against those amusements which have the
least tendency to sully the purity of your
minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Loose and immoral books; company,
whose manners are licentious, however gay
and fashionable; conversation which is even
tinctured with profaneness or obscenity; plays
in which the representation is immodest, and
offensive to the ear of chastity; indeed, pastimes
of every description, from which no advantage
can be derived, should not be countenanced;
much less applauded. Why should
those things afford apparent satisfaction in a
crowd which would call forth the blush of indignation
in more private circles? This question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>is worthy the serious attention of those
ladies, who at the theatre, can hardly restrain
their approbation of expressions and actions,
which at their houses, would be intolerably
rude and indecent, in their most familiar
friends!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cards are so much the taste of the present
day, that to caution my pupils against the too
frequent use of them may be thought old fashioned
in the extreme. I believe it, however,
to be a fascinating game, which occupies the

or profit. As the satirist humorously observes,</p>

excludes all rational conversation. That delightful
interchange of sentiment, which the
social meeting of friends is calculated to afford
and from which many advantages might be derived,
is utterly excluded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Reading, writing, drawing, needle-work,
dancing, music, walking, riding, and conversation
are amusements well adapted to yield
pleasure and utility. From either of these,
within proper bounds, there is no danger of injury
to the person or mind; though to render
even our diversions agreeable, they must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>enjoyed with moderation, and variously and
prudently conducted. Such as are peculiarly
exhilarating to the spirits, however innocent in
themselves, should be more cautiously and
sparingly indulged.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When once the mind becomes too much
relaxed by dissipating pastimes, it is proportionably
vitiated, and negligent of those nice
attentions to the rules of reserve and decorum
which ought never to be suspended. Intoxicating
is the full draught of pleasure to the youthful
mind; and fatal are the effects of unrestrained
passions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Flavia was the daughter of a gentleman,
whose political principles obliged him to leave
his country at the commencement of the
American revolution. At that time she was at
nurse in a neighboring village; between
which and the metropolis all communication
being cut off, he was reduced to the necessity
of leaving her to the mercy of those to
whom she was entrusted. Having received her
from pecuniary motives only, they no sooner
found themselves deprived of the profits of their
labor and care, than they sought relief by an application
to the town for her support. A wealthy
farmer in the vicinity, who had often seen
and been pleased with the dawning charms of
Flavia, pitied her condition, and having no children
of his own, resolved to shelter her from
the impending storm, till she could be better
provided for. At his house she was brought
up in a homely, though comfortable manner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The good man and his wife were excessively
fond of her, and gave her every instruction
and advantage in their power. Plain truths
were liberally inculcated, and every exertion
made to give her a habit of industry and good
nature. Flavia requited their kindness by an
obliging and cheerful, a docile and submissive
deportment. As she advanced in years, she
increased in beauty. Her amiable disposition
rendered her beloved, and her personal accomplishments
made her admired by all the village
swains. The approbating smile of Flavia
was the reward of their toils, and the favor
of her hand in the rustic dance was emulously
sought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In this state, Flavia was happy. Health
and innocence were now her portion; nor had
ambition as yet taught her to sigh for pleasure
beyond the reach of her attainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the arrival of her father, who had
been permitted to return, and re-possess the
estate which he had abandoned, put a period
to the simplicity and peace of Flavia’s mind.
He sought and found her; and though sensible
of his obligations to her foster-parents for
snatching her from want and distress, still he
could not prevail on himself to make so great
a sacrifice to gratitude as they wished, by permitting
his daughter to spend her days in obscurity.
The lively fancy of Flavia was allured
by the splendid promises and descriptions
of her father; and she readily consented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>to leave the friends of her childhood and youth,
and explore the walks of fashionable life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When she arrived in town, what new
scenes opened upon the dazzled eyes of the
admiring, and admired Flavia!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wealth, with its attendant train of splendid
forms and ceremonies, courted her attention,
and every species of dissipating amusement,
sanctioned by the name of pleasure, beguiled
the hours and charmed the imagination
of the noviciate. Each enchanting scene she
painted to herself in the brightest colours; and
her experienced heart promised her happiness
without allay. Flattery gave her a thousand
charms which she was hitherto unconscious
of possessing, and the obsequiousness
of the gaudy train around raised her vanity to
the highest pitch of arrogance and pride. Behold
Flavia, now, launched into the whirlpool
of fashionable folly. Balls, plays, cards, and
parties engross every portion of her time.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her father saw, too late, the imprudence
of his unbounded indulgence; and his egregious
mistake, in so immediately reversing her
mode of life, without first furnishing her mind
with sufficient knowledge and strength to repel
temptation. He endeavored to regulate
and restrain her conduct; but in vain. She
complained of this, as an abridgment of her
liberty, and took advantage of his doating fondness
to practise every excess. Involved in
expenses (of which losses at play composed a
considerable part) beyond her power to defray,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in this embarrassing dilemma, she was
reduced to the necessity of accepting the
treacherous offer of Marius to advance money
for the support of her extravagance. Obligated
by his apparent kindness, she could not refuse
the continuance of his acquaintance, till his
delusive arts had obtained the reward he proposed
to himself, in the sacrifice of her honor.
At length she awoke to a trembling sense of
her guilt, and found it fatal to her peace, reputation,
and happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wretched Flavia! no art could conceal
thy shame! The grief of her mind, her retirement
from company, and the alteration in
her appearance, betrayed her to her father’s
observation. Highly incensed at the ingratitude
and baseness of her conduct, he refused
to forgive her; but sent her from the ensnaring
pleasures of the town, to languish out the remainder
of life in solitude and obscurity.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>FILIAL AND FRATERNAL AFFECTION.</h3>

<p class='c009'>“The filial and fraternal are the first duties
of a single state. The obligations you are
under to your parents cannot be discharged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>but by a uniform and cheerful obedience; an
unreserved and ready compliance with their
wishes, added to the most diligent attention to
their ease and happiness. The virtuous and affectionate
behaviour of children is the best compensation,
in their power, for that unwearied
care and solicitude which parents, only, know.
Upon daughters, whose situation and employments
lead them more frequently into scenes
of domestic tenderness; who are often called
to smooth the pillow of sick and aged parents,
and to administer with a skilful and delicate
hand the cordial, restorative to decaying nature,
and endearing sensibility, and a dutiful
acquiescence in the dispositions, and even peculiarities
of those from whom they have derived
existence, are indispensably incumbent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Such a conduct will yield a satisfaction of
mind more than equivalent to any little sacrifices
of inclination or humour which may be
required at your hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pope, among all his admired poetry, has
not six lines more beautifully expressive than
the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>And keep awhile one parent from the sky!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Next in rank and importance to filial piety,
is fraternal love. This is a natural affection
which you cannot too assiduously cultivate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>How delightful to see children of the
same family dwell together in unity; promoting
each other’s welfare, and emulous only to
excel in acts of kindness and good will. Between
brothers and sisters the connexion is
equally intimate and endearing. There is
such a union of interests, and such an undivided
participation of enjoyments, that every
sensible and feeling mind must value the blessings
of family friendship and peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strive, therefore, my dear pupils, to promote
them, as objects which deserve your
particular attention; as attainments which will
not fail richly to reward your labour.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Prudelia, beside other amiable endowments
of person and mind, possessed the most
lively sensibility, and ardent affections.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The recommendations of her parents, united
to her own wishes, had induced her to give
her hand to Clodius, a gentleman of distinguished
merit. He was a foreigner; and his
business required his return to his native country.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Prudelia bid a reluctant adieu to her
friends, and embarked with him. She lived
in affluence, and was admired and caressed by
all that knew her, while a lovely family was
rising around her. Yet these pleasing circumstances
and prospects could not extinguish
or alienate that affection, which still glowed
in her breast for the natural guardians and
companions of her childhood and youth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“With the deepest affliction she heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>news of her father’s death, and the embarrassed
situation in which he had left his affairs.
She was impatient to console her widowed
mother, and to minister to her necessities.
For these purposes, she prevailed on her husband
to consent that she should visit her, though
it was impossible for him to attend her. With
all the transport of dutiful zeal, she flew to
the arms of her bereaved parent. But how
great was her astonishment and grief, when
told that her only sister had been deluded by
an affluent villain, and by his insidious arts,
seduced from her duty, her honor, and her
home! The emotions of pity, indignation, regret,
and affection, overwhelmed her, at first;
but recollecting herself, and exerting all her
fortitude, she nobly resolved, if possible, to
snatch the guilty, yet beloved Myra, from ruin,
rather than revenge her injured family by
abandoning her to the infamy she deserved.
To this intent she wrote her a pathetic letter,
lamenting her elopement, but entreating her,
notwithstanding, to return and receive her
fraternal embrace. But Myra, conscious of
her crime, and unworthiness of her sister’s
condescension and kindness, and above all,
dreading the superiority of her virtue, refused
the generous invitation. Prudelia was not
thus to be vanquished in her benevolent undertaking.
She even followed her to her lodgings,
and insisted on an interview. Here she
painted, in the most lively colours, the heinousness
of her offence, and the ignominy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>wretchedness that awaited her. Her affection
allured, her reasoning convinced her backsliding
sister. Upon the promise of forgiveness
from her mother, Myra consented to
leave her infamous paramour, and re-trace the
paths of rectitude and virtue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her seducer was absent on a journey.
She, therefore, wrote him a farewell letter,
couched in terms of sincere penitence for her
transgression, and determined resolution of
amendment in future, and left the house. Thus
restored and reconciled to her friends, Myra
appeared in quite another character.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Prudelia tarried with her mother till she
had adjusted her affairs, and seen her comfortably
settled and provided for. Then taking
her reclaimed sister with her, she returned to
her anxiously expecting family. The uprightness
and modesty of Myra’s conduct, ever after,
rendered her universally esteemed, though
the painful consciousness of her defection was
never extinguished in her own bosom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A constant sense of her past misconduct
depressed her spirits, and cast a gloom over
her mind; yet she was virtuous, though pensive,
during the remainder of her life.</p>

view, how necessary, how important are filial

<h3 class='c008'>FRIENDSHIP.</h3>

<p class='c009'>“Friendship is a term much insisted on by
young people; but, like many others more
frequently used than understood. A friend,
with girls in general, is an intimate acquaintance,
whose taste and pleasures are similar to
their own; who will encourage, or at least
connive at their foibles and faults, and communicate
with them every secret; in particular
those of love and gallantry, in which those
of the other sex are concerned. By such
friends their errors and stratagems are flattered
and concealed, while the prudent advice of
real friendship is neglected, till they find too
late, how fictitious a character, and how vain
a dependence they have chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Augusta and Serena were educated at the
same school, resided in the same neighborhood,
and were equally volatile in their tempers,
and dissipated in their manners. Hence every
plan of amusement was concerted and enjoyed
together. At the play, the ball, the card-table
and every other party of pleasure, they
were companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Their parents saw that this intimacy
strengthened the follies of each; and strove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to disengage their affections, that they might
turn their attention to more rational entertainments,
and more judicious advisers. But
they gloried in their friendship, and thought it
a substitute for every other virtue. They
were the dupes of adulation, and the votaries
of coquetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The attentions of a libertine, instead of
putting them on their guard against encroachments,
induced them to triumph in their fancied
conquests, and to boast of resolution
sufficient to shield them from delusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Love, however, which with such dispositions,
is the pretty play-thing of imagination,
assailed the tender heart of Serena. A gay
youth, with more wit than sense, more show
than substance, more art than honesty, took
advantage of her weakness to ingratiate himself
into her favour, and persuade her they
could not live without each other. Augusta
was the confident of Serena. She fanned the
flame, and encouraged her resolution of promoting
her own felicity, though at the expense
of every other duty. Her parents suspected
her amour, remonstrated against the man, and
forbade her forming any connexion with him, on
pain of their displeasure. She apparently acquiesced;
but flew to Augusta for counsel
and relief. Augusta soothed her anxiety, and
promised to assist her in the accomplishment
of all her wishes. She accordingly contrived
means for a clandestine intercourse, both personal
and epistolary.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“Aristus was a foreigner, and avowed his
purpose of returning to his native country, urging
her to accompany him. Serena had a
fortune, independent of her parents, left her
by a deceased relation. This, with her hand,
she consented to give to her lover, and to quit
a country, in which she acknowledged but
one friend. Augusta praised her fortitude, and
favored her design. She accordingly eloped,
and embarked. Her parents were almost
distracted by her imprudent and undutiful conduct,
and their resentment fell on Augusta, who
had acted contrary to all the dictates of integrity
and friendship, in contributing to her ruin;
for ruin it proved. Her ungrateful paramour,
having rioted on the property which she bestowed,
abandoned her to want and despair.
She wrote to her parents, but received no answer.
She represented her case to Augusta,
and implored relief from her friendship; but
Augusta alleged that she had already incurred
the displeasure of her family on her account
and chose not again to subject herself to censure
by the same means.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Serena at length returned to her native
shore, and applied in person to Augusta, who
coolly told her that she wished no intercourse
with a vagabond, and then retired. Her parents
refused to receive her into their house;
but from motives of compassion and charity,
granted her a small annuity, barely sufficient
to keep her and her infant from want.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Too late she discovered her mistaken notions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of friendship; and learned by sad experience,
that virtue must be its foundation, or
sincerity and constancy can never be its reward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sincerity and constancy are essential ingredients
in virtuous friendship. It invariably
seeks the permanent good of its object; and
in so doing, will advise, caution and reprove,
with all the frankness of undissembled affection.
In the interchange of genuine friendship,
flattery is utterly excluded. Yet, even in the
most intimate connexions of this kind, a proper
degree of respect, attention and politeness
must be observed. You are not so far to presume
on the partiality of friendship, as to hazard
giving offence, and wounding the feelings
of persons, merely because you think their regard
for you will plead your excuse, and procure
your pardon. Equally cautious should
you be, of taking umbrage at circumstances
which are undesignedly offensive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hear the excellent advice of the wise son
of Sirach, upon this subject:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Admonish thy friend; it may be he hath
not done it; and if he have done it, that he
do it no more. Admonish thy friend; it may
be he hath not said it; and if he have, that
he speak it not again. Admonish thy friend;
for many times it is a slander; and believe
not every tale. There is one that slippeth in
his speech, but not from his heart; and
who is he that offendeth not with his
tongue?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Be not hasty in forming friendships; but
deliberately examine the principles, disposition,
temper and manners, of the person you wish to
sustain this important character. Be well assured
that they are agreeable to your own,
and such as merit your entire esteem and confidence,
before you denominate her your
friend. You may have many general acquaintances,
with whom you are pleased and entertained;
but in the chain of friendship there is
a still closer link.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Reserve will wound it, and distrust destroy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deliberate on all things with thy friend:</div>
      <div class='line'>But since friends grow not thick on every bough</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor ev’ry friend unrotten at the core,</div>
      <div class='line'>First on thy friend, deliberate with thyself:</div>
      <div class='line'>Pause, ponder, first: not eager in the choice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor jealous of the chosen: fixen, fix:</div>
      <div class='line'>Judge before friendship: then confide till death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“But if you would have friends, you must
show yourselves friendly; that is, you must
be careful to act the part you wish from
another. If your friend have faults, mildly
and tenderly represent them to her; but conceal
them as much as possible from the observation
of the world. Endeavor to convince
her of her errors, to rectify her mistakes, and
to confirm and increase every virtuous sentiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Should she so far deviate, as to endanger
her reputation and happiness; and should your
admonitions fail to reclaim her, become not,
like Augusta, an abettor of her crimes. It is
not the part of friendship to hide transactions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>which will end in the ruin of your friend.
Rather acquaint those who ought to have the
rule over her of her intended missteps, and
you will have discharged your duty; you will
merit, and very probably may afterwards receive
her thanks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Narcissa and Florinda were united in the
bonds of true and generous friendship. Narcissa
was called to spend a few months with a
relation in the metropolis, where she became
acquainted with, and attached to a man who
was much her inferior; but whose specious
manners and appearance deceived her youthful
heart, though her reason and judgment informed
her, that her parents would disapprove
the connexion. She returned home, the consciousness
of her fault, the frankness which she
owed to her friend, and her partiality to her
lover, wrought powerfully upon her mind, and
rendered her melancholy. Florinda soon explored
the cause, and warmly remonstrated
against her imprudence in holding a moment’s
intercourse with a man, whom she knew, would
be displeasing to her parents. She searched
out his character, and found it far inadequate
to Narcissa’s merit. This she represented to
her in its true colours, and conjured her not
to sacrifice her reputation, her duty and her
happiness, by encouraging his addresses; but
to no purpose were her expostulations. Narcissa
avowed the design of permitting him to
solicit the consent of her parents, and the determination
of marrying him without it, if they
refused.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Florinda was alarmed at this resolution;
and, with painful anxiety, saw the danger of
her friend. She told her plainly, that the regard
she had for her demanded a counteraction
of her design; and that if she found no
other way of preventing its execution, she
should discharge her duty by informing her
parents of her proceedings. This Narcissa resented,
and immediately withdrew her confidence
and familiarity; but the faithful Florinda
neglected not the watchful solicitude of
friendship; and when she perceived that Narcissa’s
family were resolutely opposed to her
projected match and that Narcissa was preparing
to put her rash purpose into execution, she
made known the plan which she had concerted
and by that mean prevented her destruction.
Narcissa thought herself greatly injured, and
declared that she would never forgive so flagrant
a breach of fidelity. Florinda endeavoured
to convince her of her good intentions,
and the real kindness of her motives; but she
refused to hear the voice of wisdom, till a separation
from her lover, and a full proof of his
unworthiness opened her eyes to a sight of her
own folly and indiscretion, and to a lively
sense of Florinda’s friendship, in saving her
from ruin without her consent. Her heart
overflowed with gratitude to her generous
preserver. She acknowledged herself indebted
to Florinda’s benevolence, for deliverance
from the baneful impetuosity of her own passions.
She sought and obtained forgiveness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and ever after lived in the strictest amity with
her faithful benefactress.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>LOVE.</h3>

<p class='c009'>“The highest state of friendship which this
life admits, is in the conjugal relation. On
this refined affection, love, which is but a more
interesting and tender kind of friendship, ought
to be founded. The same virtues, the same
dispositions and qualities which are necessary
in a friend, are still more requisite in a companion
for life. And when these enlivening
principles are united, they form the basis of
durable happiness. But let not the mask of
friendship, or of love, deceive you. You are
now entering upon a new stage of action
where you will probably admire, and be admired.
You may attract the notice of many,
who will select you as objects of adulation, to
discover their taste and gallantry; and perhaps
of some whose affections you have really
and seriously engaged. The first class your
penetration will enable you to detect; and
your good sense and virtue will lead you to
treat them with the neglect they deserve. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>is disreputable for a young lady to receive and
encourage the officious attentions of those
mere pleasure-hunters, who rove from fair to
fair, with no other design than the exercise of
their art, addresses, and intrigue. Nothing can
render their company pleasing, but a vanity of
being caressed, and a false pride in being
thought an object of general admiration, with
a fondness for flattery which bespeaks a vitiated
mind. But when you are addressed by a
person of real merit, who is worthy your esteem
and may justly demand your respect, let him
be treated with honor, frankness and sincerity.
It is the part of a prude, to affect a shyness,
reserve, and indifference, foreign to the heart.
Innocence and virtue will rise superior to such
little arts, and indulge no wish which needs
disguise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Still more unworthy are the insidious and
deluding wiles of the coquette. How disgusting
must this character appear to persons of
sentiment and integrity! how unbecoming the
delicacy and dignity of an uncorrupted female!</p>

<p class='c000'>“As you are young and inexperienced,
your affections may possibly be involuntarily
engaged, where prudence and duty forbid a
connexion. Beware, then how you admit the
passion of love. In young minds, it is of all
others the most uncontrollable. When fancy
takes the reins, it compels its blinded votary
to sacrifice reason, discretion and conscience
to its impetuous dictates. But a passion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>this origin tends not to substantial and durable
happiness. To secure this, it must be quite
of another kind, enkindled by esteem, founded
on merit, strengthened by congenial dispositions
and corresponding virtues, and terminating
in the most pure and refined affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never suffer your eyes to be charmed by
the mere exterior; nor delude yourselves
with the notion of unconquerable love. The
eye, in this respect, is often deceptious, and
fills the imagination with charms which have
no reality. Nip, in the bud, every particular
liking, much more all ideas of love, till called
forth by unequivocal tokens as well as professions
of sincere regard. Even then, harbor
them not without a thorough knowledge of
the temper, disposition and circumstances of
your lover, the advice of your friends; and,
above all the approbation of your parents.
Maturely weigh every consideration for and
against, and deliberately determine with yourselves,
what will be most conducive to your
welfare and fidelity in life. Let a rational and
discreet plan of thinking and acting, regulate
your deportment, and render you deserving
of the affection you wish to insure. This
you will find far more conducive to your interest,
than the indulgence of that romantic
passion, which a blind and misguided fancy
paints in such alluring colors to the thoughtless
and inexperienced.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Recollect the favourite air you so often

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“I by no means undervalue that love which
is the noblest principle of the human mind;
but wish only to guard you against the influence
of an ill-placed and ungovernable
passion, which is improperly called by this
name.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A union, formed without a refined and
generous affection for its basis, must be devoid
of those tender endearments, reciprocal
attentions, and engaging sympathies, which
are peculiarly necessary to alleviate the cares,
dispel the sorrows, and soften the pains of
life. The exercise of that prudence and
caution which I have recommended, will lead
you to a thorough investigation of the character
and views of the man by whom you are
addressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Without good principles, both of religion
and morality, (for the latter cannot exist independent
of the former) you can not safely rely,
either upon his fidelity or his affection.
Good principles are the foundation of a good
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the fountain be pure, the streams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>which issue from it will be of the same description.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Next to this, an amiable temper is essentially
requisite. A proud, a passionate, a revengeful,
a malicious, or a jealous temper,
will render your lives uncomfortable, in spite
of all the prudence and fortitude you can
exert.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beware, then, lest, before marriage, love
blind your eyes to those defects, to a sight of
which, grief and disappointment may awaken
you afterwards. You are to consider marriage
as a connexion for life; as the nearest and
dearest of all human relations; as involving in
it the happiness or misery of all your days;
and as engaging you in a variety of cares and
duties, hitherto unknown. Act, therefore,
with deliberation, and resolve with caution;
but, when once you come to a choice,
behave with undeviating rectitude and sincerity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Avarice is not commonly a ruling passion
in young persons of <em>our</em> sex. Yet some there
are, sordid enough to consider wealth as the
chief good, and to sacrifice every other object
to a splendid appearance. It often happens,
that these are miserably disappointed in
their expectations of happiness. They find,
by dear bought experience, that external pomp
is but a wretched substitute for internal satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I would not have outward circumstances
entirely overlooked. A proper regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>should always be had to a comfortable subsistence
in life. Nor can you be justified in suffering
a blind passion, under whatever pretext,
to involve you in those embarrassing distresses
of want, which will elude the remedies of love
itself, and prove fatal to the peace and happiness
at which you aim.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In this momentous affair, let the advice
and opinion of judicious friends have their just
weight in your minds. Discover, with candor
and frankness, the progress of your amour, so
far as is necessary to enable them to judge
aright in the cause; but never relate the love
tales of your suitor, merely for your own, or
any other person’s amusement. The tender
themes inspired by love, may be pleasing to
you; but to an uninterested person, must be
insipid and disgusting in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never boast of the number, nor of the
professions of your admirers. That betrays
an unsufferable vanity, and will render you
perfectly ridiculous in the estimation of observers.
Besides, it is a most ungenerous
treatment of those who may have entertained,
and expressed a regard for you. Whatever
they have said upon this subject, was doubtless
in confidence, and you ought to keep
it sacred, as a secret you have no right to divulge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you disapprove the person, and reject
his suit, that will be sufficiently mortifying,
without adding the insult of exposing his overtures.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Be very careful to distinguish real lovers
from mere gallants. Think not every man
enamoured with you, who is polite and attentive.
You have no right to suppose any
man in love with you, till he declares it in
plain, unequivocal and decent terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never suffer, with impunity, your ear to
be wounded by indelicate expressions, double
entendres, and insinuating attempts to seduce
you from the path of rectitude. True love
will not seek to degrade its object, much less
to undermine that virtue which ought to be its
basis and support. Let no protestations induce
you to believe that person your friend,
who would destroy your dearest interests, and
rob you of innocence and peace. Give no
heed to the language of seduction; but repel
the insidious arts of the libertine, with the dignity
and decision of insulted virtue. This
practice will raise you superior to the wiles
of deceivers, and render you invulnerable by
the specious flattery of the unprincipled and
debauched.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Think not the libertine worthy of your
company and conversation even as an acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That reformed rakes make the best husbands,”
is a common, and I am sorry to say,
a too generally received maxim. Yet I cannot
conceive, that any lady who values, or
properly considers her own happiness, will
venture on the dangerous experiment. The
term <em>reformed</em> can, in my opinion, have very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>little weight; since those, whose principles
are vitiated, and whose minds are debased by
a course of debauchery and excess, seldom
change their pursuits, till necessity, or interest
requires it; and, however circumstances
may alter or restrain their conduct, very little
dependence can be placed on men whose
disposition is still the same, but only prevented
from indulgence by prudential motives. As a
rake is most conversant with the dissolute and
abandoned of both sexes, he doubtless forms
his opinion of others by the standard to which
he has been accustomed, and therefore supposes
all women of the same description.
Having been hackneyed in the arts of the baser
sort, he cannot form an idea, that any are
in reality superior to them. This renders
him habitually jealous, peevish and tyrannical.
Even if his vicious inclinations be changed,
his having passed his best days in vice and
folly, renders him a very unsuitable companion
for a person of delicacy and refinement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But whatever inducements some ladies
may have to risk themselves with those who
have the reputation of being reformed, it is
truly surprising that any should be so inconsiderate
as to unite with such as are still professed
libertines. What hopes of happiness
can be formed with men of this character?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Vice and virtue can never assimilate;
and hearts divided by them can never coalesce.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The former is the parent of discord,
disease and death; the latter, of harmony,
health and peace. A house divided against
itself cannot stand; much less can domestic
felicity subsist between such contrasted dispositions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But however negligent or mistaken many
women of real merit may be, relative to their
own interest, I cannot but wish they would
pay some regard to the honor and dignity of
their sex. Custom only has rendered vice
more odious in a woman than in a man. And
shall we give our sanction to a custom, so unjust
and destructive in its operation; a custom
which invites and encourages the enemies
of society to seek our ruin? Were those who
glory in the seduction of innocence, to meet
with the contempt they deserve, and to be
pointedly neglected by every female of virtue,
they would be ashamed of their evil practices,
and impelled to relinquish their injurious designs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But while they are received and caressed
in the best companies, they find restraint altogether
needless; and their being men of
spirit and gallantry (as they style themselves)
is rather a recommendation than a reproach!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot help blushing with indignation,
when I see a lady of sense and character gallanted
and entertained by a man who ought to
be banished from society, for having ruined
the peace of families, and blasted the reputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of many, who but for him, might have been
useful and happy in the world; but who by
his insidious arts, are plunged into remediless
insignificance, disgrace and misery.”</p>

<h3 class='c008'>RELIGION.</h3>

<p class='c009'>“Having given you my sentiments on a
variety of subjects which demand your particular
attention, I come now to the closing
and most important theme; and that is religion.
The virtuous education you have received,
and the good principles which have
been instilled into your minds from infancy,
will render the enforcement of Christian precepts
and duties a pleasing lesson.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Religion is to be considered as an essential
and durable object; not as the embellishment
of a day; but an acquisition which
shall endure and increase through the endless
ages of eternity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lay the foundation of it in youth, and it
will not forsake you in advanced age; but
furnish you with an adequate substitute for the
transient pleasures which will then desert you,
and prove a source of rational and refined delight:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a refuge from the disappointments and
corroding cares of life, and from the depressions
of adverse events. “Remember now
your creator, in the days of your youth, while
the evil days come not, nor the years draw
nigh, when you shall say we have no pleasure
in them.” If you wish for permanent happiness,
cultivate the divine favour as your highest
enjoyment in life, and your safest retreat
when death shall approach you.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That even the young are not exempt from
the arrest of this universal conqueror, the
tombstone of Amelia will tell you. Youth,
beauty, health and fortune, strewed the path
of life with flowers, and left her no wish ungratified.
Love, with its gentlest and purest
flame, animated her heart, and was equally
returned by Julius. Their passion was approved
by their parents and friends; the day was
fixed, and preparations were making for the
celebration of their nuptials. At this period
Amelia was attacked by a violent cold, which
seating on her lungs, baffled the skill of the
most eminent physicians, and terminated in a
confirmed hectic. She perceived her disorder
to be incurable, and with inexpressible regret
and concern anticipated her approaching dissolution.
She had enjoyed life too highly to
think much of death; yet die she must!
“Oh,” said she, “that I had prepared, while
in health and at ease, for this awful event!
Then should I not be subjected to the keenest
distress of mind, in addition to the most painful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>infirmities of body! Then should I be
able to look forward with hope, and to find relief
in the consoling expectation of being united
beyond the grave, with those dear and
beloved connexions, which I must soon leave
behind! Let my companions and acquaintance
learn from me the important lesson of
improving their time to the best of purposes;
of acting at once as becomes mortal and immortal
creatures!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hear, my dear pupils, the solemn admonition,
and be ye also ready!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Too many, especially of the young and
gay, seem more anxious to live in pleasure,
than to answer the end of their being, by the
cultivation of that piety and virtue which will
render them good members of society, useful
to their friends and associates, and partakers
of that heart-felt satisfaction which results
from a conscience void of offence both towards
God and man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This, however, is an egregious mistake;
for in many situations, piety and virtue are
our only source of consolation; and in all,
they are peculiarly friendly to our happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you exult in beauty, and the pride of
external charms? Turn your eyes for a moment,
on the miserable Flirtilla.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Like her,
your features and complexion may be impaired
by disease; and where then will you find
a refuge from mortification and discontent, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>destitute of those ennobling endowments which
can raise you superior to the transient graces
of a fair form, if unadorned by that substantial
beauty of mind which can not only ensure
respect from those around you, but inspire you
with resignation to the divine will, and a patient
acquiescence in the painful allotments of
a holy Providence. Does wealth await your
command, and grandeur with its fascinating
appendages beguile your fleeting moments?
Recollect, that riches often make themselves
wings and fly away. A single instance of
mismanagement; a consuming fire, with various
other misfortunes which no human prudence
can foresee or prevent, may strip you
of this dependence; and, unless you have
other grounds of comfort than earth can boast,
reduce you to the most insupportable wretchedness
and despair. Are you surrounded by
friends, and happy in the society of those who
are near and dear to you? Soon may they
be wrested from your fond embrace, and consigned
to the mansions of the dead!</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>“Whence, then, will you derive support, if
unacquainted with that divine Friend, who
will never fail nor forsake you; who is the
same yesterday, to-day and forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Health and youth, my dear girls, are the
seasons for improvement. Now you may lay
up a treasure which neither sickness nor adversity
can impair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the hour of distress is not the only
time, in which religion will be advantageous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to you. Even in prosperity, it will prove
the best solace and the highest ornament of
your lives. What can be more dignified, respectable,
and lovely, than the Christian character?
The habitual practice of those duties
which the gospel inculcates will give lustre to
your beauty and durability to your charms.
By correcting your passions, it will improve
your joys, endear you to your friends and
connexions, and render you contented, happy,
and useful in every stage and condition of
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Religion will not deprive you of temporal
enjoyments; it will heighten and increase
them. It will not depress, but exhilarate your
spirits. For it consists not in a gloomy, misanthropic
temper, declining the social and innocent
delights of life; but prepares the mind
to partake with satisfaction of every pleasure
which reason approves, and which can yield
serenity and peace in the review. Be not
ashamed then of appearing religious, and of
rising by that mean above the vain, unthinking
crowd.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let not the idle jests of heedless and unprincipled
companions deter you from a stedfast
adherence to the path of truth and
righteousness. ‘Follow not the multitude to
do evil.’ Never conform to fashion, even
though it claim the patronage of politeness, so
far as to countenance irreligion in any of its
modifications.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jesting upon sacred subjects, ridiculing
the professors of Christianity, light and irreverent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>conduct upon solemn occasions, ought
to be cautiously avoided and decidedly condemned.
Too many girls are so extremely
thoughtless as to carry the levity of their manners
even to the sanctuary; and by whispering,
winking, tittering and other indecent
actions, display their folly to their own disgrace,
and to the great disgust of all judicious
and sober people. Such behaviour is not only
offensive to the Deity, but insulting to all
who would worship him free from interruption.
It is not only an indignity offered to religion,
but a flagrant breach of the rules of good
breeding. Content not yourselves, therefore,
with a bare attendance on the institutions of
religion; but conduct with propriety, decorum,
and seriousness, while engaged in the solemn
service. Bear in mind, that you assemble
with a professed purpose of paying homage to
the Supreme; and consider yourselves as in
his immediate presence!</p>

<p class='c000'>“The offices of devotion demand your
attention in private, as well as in public.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Accustom yourselves, therefore, to stated
periods of retirement for meditation and prayer;
and adopt every other mean which is calculated
to keep alive in your minds a due sense
of your dependence and obligations, and to
inspire you with that uniform love to God and
benevolence to the human kind, which will
prove your greatest glory here, as well as
your crown of rejoicing hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The hour of departure having arrived, on
Monday morning, Mrs. Williams assembled
with her pupils; when the regret, visibly depicted
on every countenance, was variously
expressed. The tear of grateful regard stole
silently down the bloomy cheeks of some;
others betrayed their sensibility by audible
sobs, which they could not repress; and all
united in testifying the sense they entertained
of the advantages they had received from Mrs.
Williams’s tuition, the happiness they had enjoyed
in each other’s society, and their determination
to remember her counsels, cultivate
continued friendship among themselves, and
endeavor to be worthy of her’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Williams then took an affectionate
leave of each one, and left them with her
daughters. The most cordial good wishes
were mutually interchanged, till their carriages
received and separated them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The friendship and unity thus commenced
and confirmed, were never obliterated. They
always cherished the most sincere affection
for their Preceptress, and each other; which
they displayed in an unreserved and social
correspondence, both personal and epistolary.
The residence of Mrs. Williams they denominated
Harmony-Grove, which it ever after retained,
and by which it is designated in the
following selection of their letters.</p>

      <div class='line'>RESPECTED AND DEAR MADAM,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Conformably to my promise, when I left
your abode, the first efforts of my pen are
dedicated to you. The pleasure which arises
from the recollection of your more than maternal
kindness to me, especially your unwearied
endeavors to refine and embellish my mind
and to lay the foundation of right principles
and practices, is interwoven with my existence;
and no time or circumstances can erase my
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>I arrived last evening safely; and was affectionately
received by my honored parents,
and beloved brothers and sisters. The emotions
of regret which I felt in the morning, at
the painful separation from you and my dear
school-mates, with whom I have lived so happily,
had not wholly subsided. I could not
help listening, now and then, for some judicious
observation from my Preceptress; and
frequently cast my eyes around in search of
some of the amiable companions, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>whom I had been used to unbend every
thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>The splendor of the apartments gave me
ideas of restraint that were painful; and I
looked abroad for the green, where we were
wont to gambol, and the lawn where we so
often held our twilight sports, and almost fancied
that we sometimes caught a glimpse of
the attendant Sylphs who played around us;
but in vain. Stately domes, crowded streets,
rattling carriages, and all the noise and confusion
of a commercial city were substituted.
I retired to bed, and was awaked in the night
by the riotous mirth of a number of Bacchanalians,
reeling from the haunts of intemperance
and excess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alas! said I, this is not the Æolian harp
that used to soothe our slumbers at the boarding
school. I composed myself again; but
awoke at the accustomed hour of five. I
arose; and, having praised my Maker for the
preservations of the night, walked down.
Not a living creature was stirring in the
house.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took a turn in the garden. Here art
seemed to reign so perfectly mistress, that I
was apprehensive lest I should injure her
charms by viewing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I accordingly retired to the summer-house,
and, having a book in my hand, sat down and
read till the clock struck seven. I then
thought it must be breakfast time, and returned
to the house; but was much disappointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to find none of the family up, except one man
servant and the house maid who had just
crept down.</p>

<p class='c000'>They appeared perfectly astonished to see
me come in from abroad; and the girl respectfully
inquired if indisposition had occasioned
my rising so early. I told her no; that the
wish to preserve my health had called me up
two hours before. Well, rejoined she, you
will not find any body to keep you company
here for two hours to come. I was chagrined
at the information, and asked her for a bowl
of milk, it being past my usual breakfast time.
The milk man had just arrived, and I drank
some; but it had lost its flavor on the road. It
was not like that which was served us at Harmony-Grove.
I stepped to the harpsichord,
and having sung and played a morning hymn,
returned to my chamber, where, taking my
work, I sat down by the window to view the
listless tribe of yawning mortals who were beginning
to thicken in the streets. One half
of these appeared to be dragged forth by necessity,
rather than any inclination to enjoy
the beauties of a fine morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>At nine, I was summoned into the parlor
to breakfast. My sisters gently chid me for
disturbing their repose with my music. I excused
myself by alleging that I had been so
long accustomed to early rising that I should
find it difficult to alter the habit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, madam, you have an account of my
first night and morning’s occupation. Were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>I to proceed with every new occurrence,
through the year, and subjoin my own remarks,
I must write volumes instead of letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Please to communicate this scroll to your
amiable daughters, and remind them of their
promise to write.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line from Harmony-Grove would be a

of my continued friendship and affection;
but so numerous have been my avocations,
and so various my engagements, that I
have scarcely called a moment my own since
I returned home. Having been from town a
year, I was considered as too antique to appear

metamorphosed. Every part of my
habit has undergone a complete change, in
conformity to the present fashion. It was
with extreme regret that I parted with the
neatness and simplicity of my country dress;
which, according to my ideas of modesty, was
more becoming. But I trust, this alteration
of appearance will have no tendency to alienate
those sentiments from my heart which I
imbibed under the tuition of Mrs. Williams.</p>

<p class='c000'>I went, last evening, to the assembly; but
though dazzled, I was by no means charmed,
by the glare of finery and tinselled decorations
that were displayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some ladies, whose gentility and
fashionable dress were evidently the product
of a correct taste; but others were so disguised
by tawdry gewgaws, as to disgust me exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Williams used to say, that the dress
was indicative of the mind. If this observation
be just, what opinion am I to form of the
gay multitudes who trip along the streets and
throng the places of public resort in this metropolis;
the lightness and gaudiness of whose
appearance, bespeak a sickly taste, to say no
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am furnished with feathers, flowers, and
ribbons in profusion. I shall, however, use
them very sparingly; and though I would not
be entirely singular, yet I must insist on consulting
my own fancy a little, and cannot willingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>sacrifice my own opinion to the capricious
whims of fashion, and her devotees. My
aunt Lawrence, who you know, is extravagantly
genteel, is making us a visit. She
laughs very heartily at my silly notions, as
she calls them, and styles me a novice in the
ways of the world: but hopes, notwithstanding,
that I shall acquire a better taste when I
am more acquainted with fashionable life.
That I may be much improved by a more extensive
knowledge of the world, I doubt not;
yet may I never be corrupted by that levity
and folly, which are too prevalent among a
part of my sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will not, however, censure and condemn
others; but attend to myself and be humble.
Adieu.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The tear of regret for your departure is
scarcely dried from the cheek of your Maria;
and the pleasing remembrance of the happiness
I have enjoyed in your society is accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>with a sigh, whenever I reflect that it
exists no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>My mamma has observed that those friendships
which are formed in youth, provided
they be well founded, are the most sincere,
lively and durable. I am sure that the ardency
of mine can never abate; my affectionate
regard for you can never decay.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have another class of boarders; but you
and your amiable companions had so entirely
engrossed my confidence and esteem, that I
shall find it difficult to transfer them, in any
degree, to others. The sensations of Anna are
very different, though she is capable of the
most refined friendship. The natural vivacity,
and, as I tell her, the volatility of her disposition,
renders a variety of associates pleasing
to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to recall your ideas to the exercises
of Harmony-Grove, I enclose the sallies of
my pen for this morning, fully assured of your
candour and generosity in the perusal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pray omit no opportunity of writing, and
favor me with your observations on the polite
world. I shall receive every line as a pledge
of your continued love to your</p>

But I will haunt you with my letters;

<p class='c000'>What do I say? Obtrude and extort! Can
these harsh words be used when I am addressing

<p class='c000'>But you have often encouraged my eccentricities

indulge them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nature has furnished me with a gay disposition;
and happy is it for me, that a lax education
has not strengthened the folly too commonly
arising from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Williams’ instructions were very
seasonably interposed to impress my mind with
a sense of virtue and propriety. I trust they
have had the desired effect; and that they
will prove the guardian of my youth, and the
directory of maturer age. How often has the
dear, good woman taken me into her chamber,
and reminded me of indecorums of which I
was unconscious at the time; but thankful
afterwards that they had not escaped her judicious
eye; as her observations tended to
rectify my errors, and render me more cautious
and circumspect in future. How salutary is
advice like her’s; conveyed, not with the dogmatic
air of supercilious wisdom, but with
the condescending ease and soothing kindness
of an affectionate parent, anxiously concerned
for the best good of those under her care!</p>

<p class='c000'>I was very happy at Harmony-Grove; and
the result of that happiness, I hope, will accompany
me through life.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was, last evening, at a ball, and I assure
you, the attention I gained, and the gallantry
displayed to attract my notice and approbation,
were very flattering to my vanity; though I
could not forbear inwardly smiling at the futile
arts of the pretty fellows who exhibited them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their speeches appeared to have been so
long practised, that I was on the point of advising
them to exercise their genius, if they
had any, in the invention of something new.
But a polite conformity to the ton restrained
my satire, Adieu.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am disappointed and displeased, Cleora!
I have long been anxious to procure the Marchioness
de Sevigne’s letters, having often
heard them mentioned as standards of taste and
elegance in the epistolary way. This excited
my curiosity, and raised my hopes of finding
a rich entertainment of wit and sentiment. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>have perused, and perused in vain; for they
answer not my ideas of either. They are replete
with local circumstances, which to indifferent
readers, are neither amusing nor
interesting. True, the style is easy and
sprightly; but they are chiefly composed of
family matters, such as relate to her own
movements and those of her daughter; many
of which are of too trifling a nature to be
ranked in the class of elegant writing. I own
myself, however, not a competent judge of
their merit as a whole, even in my own estimation;
for I have read the two first volumes
only.</p>

<p class='c000'>That letters ought to be written with the
familiarity of personal conversation, I allow;
yet many such conversations, even between
persons of taste and refinement, are unworthy
the public attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Equal was my chagrin, not long since, on
reading Pope’s letters. He, said I to myself,
who bears the palm from all contemporary poets,
and who is so consummate a master of this
divine art, must surely furnish a source of
superior entertainment, when he descends to
friendly and social communications.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, there are good sentiments and judicious
observations, interspersed in his letters;
but the greater part of them have
little other merit than what arises from the
style.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps you will charge me with arrogance
for presuming to criticise, much more to condemn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>publications which have so long been
sanctioned by general approbation. Independent
in opinion, I write it without reserve, and
censure not any one who thinks differently.
Give me your sentiments with the same freedom
upon the books which you honor with a
perusal, and you will oblige your affectionate</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR CAROLINE,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I received yours with those lively sensations
of pleasure which your favors always
afford. As I was perusing it, my papa came
into the room. He took it out of my hand and
read it; then returning it with the smile of
approbation, I think, said he, that your correspondent
has played the critic very well.
Has she played it justly, Sir? said I. Why,
it is a long time, said he, since I read the
Marchioness de Sevigne’s letters. I am not,
therefore, judge of their merit. But with regard
to Pope, I blame not the sex for retaliating
upon him; for he always treated them
satirically. I believe revenge was no part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of my friend’s plan, said I. She is far superior
to so malignant a passion, though, were
she capable of seeking it, it would be in behalf
of her sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company now coming in, the conversation
shifted.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have often smiled at the pitiful wit of
those satirists and essayists, who lavish abundant
eloquence on trifling foibles, the mere
whims of a day; and of no consequence to
the body natural, moral, or political. The
extension of a hoop, the contraction of the
waist, or the elevation of the head-dress, frequently
afford matter for pages of elaborate
discussion. These reformers, too, always aim
at the good of our sex! I think it a great
pity they do not lop off some of their own exuberant
follies; though perhaps they wish us
to exchange labours; and in return for their
benevolent exertions, that we endeavor to expose
and correct their errors. I have sometimes
thought their satire to be tinctured with
malice; and that the cause of their disaffection
may generally be found in personal resentment.
Had Pope and his coadjutors
been favourites with the ladies, I doubt not but
they would have found more excellencies in
them than they have ever yet allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have lately been reading the generous and
polite Fitzorsborne’s letters; and I need not
tell you how much I was pleased and charmed
with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The justness of his sentiments, and the ease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and elegance of his diction, are at once interesting
and improving. His letter and ode to
his wife on the anniversary of their marriage,
surpass any thing of the kind I have ever
read. I verily think, that, had I the offer of
a heart capable of dictating such manly tenderness
of expression, and such pathetic energy
of generous love, I should be willing to
give my hand in return, and assent to those
solemn words, “love, honor, and—(I had almost
said) obey.” Adieu.</p>

<p class='c000'>I agree with you, that the habits of the
weak and vain are too insignificant to employ
the pens of those, whose literary talents might
produce great and good effects in the political,
moral, and religious state of things. Were
absurd fashions adopted only by those whose
frivolity renders them the dupes of folly, and
whose example can have no effect on the considerate
and judicious part of the community,
I should think them below the attention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>statesmen, philosophers, and divines: but this
is not the case. The votaries and the inventors
of the most fantastical fashions are found
in the ranks of, what is called, refined and
polished society; from whom we might hope
for examples of elegance and propriety, both
in dress and behaviour. By these, luxury and
extravagance are sanctioned. Their influence
upon the poorer class is increased; who, emulous
of imitating their superiors, think <em>that</em> the
most eligible appearance, (however beyond
their income, or unsuitable to their circumstances
and condition in life) which is preferred
and countenanced by their wealthier
neighbors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Absurd and expensive fashions, then, are
injurious to society at large, and require some
check; and why is not satire levelled against
them, laudable in its design, and likely to produce
a good effect? Adieu.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR CLEORA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I have this week engaged in the celebration
of the nuptials of my friend, Amanda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>South. A splendid wedding, a gay company,
an elegant supper, and a magnificent ball,
were the sum of our entertainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>I imagine such exhilarating scenes designed
to dispel the anxiety and thoughtfulness,
which every reflecting person must feel on
this solemn occasion. This untried state presents
to the apprehensive mind such a variety
of new cares and duties, that cheerfulness,
festivity and hilarity seem necessary to banish
the thought of them, so far as to render
a delicate and sensible female sufficiently
composed to conduct with propriety. But I
must confess that were I called to the trial,
I should choose to retire from the observation
of those indifferent and unfeeling spectators,
to whom the blushing modesty of a bride
is often a pastime.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, Cleora, when we look around the
world and observe the great number of unhappy
marriages, which were contracted with
the brightest prospects, yet from some unforeseen
cause, have involved the parties in
wretchedness for life, we may well indulge a
diffidence of our own abilities to discharge the
duties of the station, and be solicitous that
our future companion should in all respects be
qualified to assist in bearing the burdens of
the conjugal state.</p>

<p class='c000'>Experience only can determine how far we
are right in the judgment we form of ourselves,
and of the person of our choice. So many
are the deceptions which love and courtship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>impose upon their votaries, that I believe it
very difficult for the parties concerned to judge
impartially, or to discern faults, where they
look only for virtues. Hence they are so frequently
misled in their opinions, and find, too
late, the errors into which they have been betrayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When do you come to Boston, Cleora? I
am impatient for your society; because your
friendship is void of flattery, and your sincerity
and cheerfulness are always agreeable and
advantageous. Adieu.</p>

What mortal else would feel serious and sentimental
at a wedding? Positively, you shall
not come to mine. Your presence, I fear,
would put such a restraint upon me, as to render
me quite foolish and awkward in my appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>However, I must acknowledge it a weighty
affair; and what you say has, perhaps, too
much truth in it to be jested with. I believe,
therefore, we had better resolve not to risk
the consequences of a wrong choice, or imprudent
conduct; but wisely devote ourselves
to celibacy. I am sure we should make a
couple of very clever old maids. If you
agree to this proposition, we will begin in
season to accustom ourselves to the virtues
and habits of a single life. By observing
what is amiss in the conduct of others in the
same state, and avoiding their errors, I doubt
not but we may bring even the title into repute.
In this way we shall be useful to many
of our own sex, though I am aware it would
be a most grievous dispensation to a couple
of the other; but no matter for that.</p>

<p class='c000'>The world needs some such examples as
we might become; and if we can be instrumental
of retrieving <em>old-maidism</em> from the
imputation of ill-nature, oddity, and many
other mortifying charges, which are now
brought against it, I believe we shall save
many a good girl from an unequal and unhappy
marriage. It might have a salutary
effect on the other sex too. Finding the ladies
independent in sentiment, they would be
impelled to greater circumspection of conduct
to merit their favor.</p>

<p class='c000'>You see that my benevolence is extensive.
I wish to become a general reformer. What
say you to my plan, Harriot? If you approve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>it, dismiss your long train of admirers immediately,
and act not the part of a coquette, by
retaining them out of pride or vanity. We
must rise above such narrow views, and let
the world know that we act from principle, if
we mean to do good by our example. I shall
continue to receive the addresses of this same
Junius, till I hear that you have acceded to
my proposal; and then, display my fortitude
by renouncing a connexion which must be
doubtful as to the issue, and will certainly expose
me to the mortification of being looked
at, when I am married. Farewell.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR CAROLINE,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I have just returned from a rural excursion,
where, in the thicket of a grove, I enjoyed all
the luxury of solitude. The sun had nearly
finished his diurnal course, and was leaving
our hemisphere to illuminate the other with
his cheering rays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sprightly songsters had retired to their
bowers, and were distending their little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>throats with a tribute of instinctive gratitude
and praise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vocal strains re-echoed from tree to tree
and invited me to join the responsive notes.
My heart expanded with devotion and benevolence.
I wished the whole human kind to
share the feelings of happiness which I enjoyed;
while the inanimate creation around
seemed to partake of my satisfaction! Methought
the fields assumed a livelier verdure;
and the zephyrs were unusually officious in
wafting the fragrance of aromatic gales. I
surveyed the surrounding scenery with rapturous
admiration; and my heart glowed with
inexpressible delight at the lovely appearance
of nature, and the diffusive bounties of its almighty
author.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let others, said I, exult in stately domes,
and the superfluities of pomp; immerse themselves
in the splendid novelties of fashion, and
a promiscuous crowd of giddy amusements!
I envy them not.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Give me a mind to range the sylvan scene,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And taste the blessings of the vernal day;</div>
      <div class='line'>While social joys, and friendly, intervene</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To chase the gloomy cares of life away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I wish not to abandon society, nor to resign
the pleasures which it affords; but it is a
select number of friends, not a promiscuous
crowd, which I prefer.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the mind is much engrossed by dissipating
pleasures, it is apt to forget itself, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>neglect its own dignity and improvement. It
is necessary often to retreat from the noise
and bustle of the world, and commune with
our own hearts. By this mean we shall be the
better qualified both to discharge the duties
and participate in the enjoyments of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Solitude affords a nearer and more distinct
view of the works of creation; elevates the
mind, and purifies its passions and affections.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR SISTER,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I am not so far engaged by the new scenes
of fashionable gaiety which surround me, as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>forget you and the other dear friends, whom
I left at Harmony-Grove. Yet so great is the
novelty which I find in this crowded metropolis,
that you cannot wonder if my attention is
very much engrossed. Mr. and Mrs. Henly,
with their amiable daughters, are extremely
polite and attentive to me; and having taken
every method to contribute to my amusement,
I went yesterday, in their company, to Commencement,
at Cambridge; and was very
much entertained with the exhibition. I pretend
not to be a judge of the talents displayed
by the young gentlemen who took an active
part, or of the proficiency they had made in
science. I have an opinion of my own, notwithstanding;
and can tell how far my eye
and ear were gratified.</p>

<p class='c000'>I never knew before, that dress was a classical
study; which I now conclude it must be,
or it would not have exercised the genius of
some of the principal speakers on this public
occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The female garb too, seemed to claim particular
attention. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon ton</span></i>, taste and
fashions of our sex, afforded a subject of declamation
to the orator; and of entertainment
to the audience, composed, in part, of our legislators,
politicians, and divines! I could not
but think that those scholars who employ their
time in studying, investigating and criticising
the ladies’ dresses, might as well be occupied
in the business of a friseur or the man-milliner;
either of which would afford them more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>frequent opportunities for the display of their
abilities, and render their labors more extensively
useful to the sex. Others might
then improve the time, which they thus frivolously
engrossed on this anniversary, in contributing
to the entertainment of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</span></i>,
who doubtless expect to be gratified by the
exertions of genius and an apparent progress
in those studies, which are designed to qualify
the rising youth of America for important stations
both in church and state.</p>

<p class='c000'>The assembly was extremely brilliant; the
ladies seemed to vie with each other in magnificent
decorations. So much loveliness
was visible in their native charms, that without
any hint from the speakers of the day, I
should have thought it a pity to add those
foreign ornaments, which rather obscure than
aid them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was a little displeased by the unbecoming
levity of some of my sex; and am apprehensive
lest it might induce misjudging and censorious
people to imagine that they were led
thither more by the vanity of attracting notice,
than to receive any mental entertainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without our consent, we ran a race back to
town, which endangered our necks. The
avaricious hackman, desirous of returning for
another freight, had no mercy on his passengers
or horses. However, we arrived safely,
though much fatigued by the pleasure of the
day.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Pleasure carried to excess degenerates into
pain. This I actually experienced; and
sighed for the tranquil enjoyments of Harmony
grove, to which I propose soon to return,
and convince you how affectionately I am
your’s,</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR ANNA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Your enlivening letter restored us, in some
measure, to your society; or at least, alleviated
the pain of your absence.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am glad you attended commencement. It
was a new scene, and consequently extended
your ideas. I think you rather severe on the
classical gentlemen. We simple country folks
must not presume to arraign their taste, whose
learning and abilities render them conspicuous
on the literary stage. They, doubtless,
write on subjects better adapted to their capacities.
As for the follies of fashion, I think the
gentlemen are under obligations to the ladies
for adopting them; since it gives exercise to
their genius and pens.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>You were tired, you say, with pleasure. I
believe those dissipating scenes, which greatly
exhilarate the spirits, call for the whole attention,
and oblige us to exert every power, are
always fatiguing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pleasures of a calmer kind, which are moderately
enjoyed, which enliven rather then exhaust,
and which yield a serenity of mind on
reflection, are the most durable, rational and
satisfying. Pleasure is the most alluring object
which is presented to the view of the
young and inexperienced. Under various
forms it courts our attention; but while we
are still eager in the pursuit, it eludes our
grasp. Its fascinating charms deceive the imagination,
and create a bower of bliss in every
distant object.</p>

<p class='c000'>But let us be careful not to fix our affections
on any thing, which bears this name, unless it
be founded on virtue, and will endure the severest
scrutiny of examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our honored mamma, and all your friends
here, are impatient for your return. They
unitedly long to embrace, and bid you welcome
to these seats of simplicity and ease:
but none more ardently than your affectionate
sister,</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR MATILDA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Anxious to make the best possible use of
the education I have received; and fully impressed
with the idea, that the human mind is
capable of continual improvements, it is my
constant endeavor to extract honey from every
flower which falls in my way, or, to speak
without a figure, to derive advantage from
every incident. Pursuant to the advice of
our excellent Preceptress, I keep this perpetually
in view; and am therefore disappointed
when defeated in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>This afternoon I have been in company with
three ladies, celebrated for their beauty and
wit. One of them I think may justly claim
the reputation of beauty. To a finished form,
and florid complexion, an engaging, animating
countenance is added. Yet a consciousness
of superior charms was apparent in her
deportment; and a supercilious air counteracted
the effects of her personal accomplishments.
The two others were evidently more
indebted to art than to nature for their appearance.
It might easily be discovered that
paint constituted all the delicacy of their complexion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>What a pity that so many are deceived in
their ideas of beauty! Certain it is, that artificial
additions serve rather to impair than
increase its power. “Who can paint like nature?”
What hand is skilful enough to supply
her defects? Do not those who attempt it
always fail, and render themselves disgusting?
Do they not really injure what they strive to
mend; and make it more indifferent than
usual, when divested of its temporary embellishments?
Beauty cannot possibly maintain
its sway over its most obsequious votaries, unless
the manners and the mind unitedly contribute
to secure it. How vain then is this
subterfuge! It may deceive the eye and
gain the flattery of the prattling coxcomb;
but accumulated neglect and mortification inevitably
await those who trust in the wretched
alternative.</p>

<p class='c000'>From their good sense, I had been led to
expect the greatest entertainment. I therefore
waited impatiently till the first compliments
were over, and conversation commenced.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to my extreme regret, I found it to
consist of ludicrous insinuations, hackneyed
jests and satirical remarks upon others of their
acquaintance who were absent. The pretty
fellows of the town were criticised; and their
own adventures in shopping, were related with
so much minuteness, hilarity, and glee, that
I blushed for the frivolous levity of those of
my sex, who could substitute buffoonery for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>wit, and the effusions of a perverted imagination,
for that refined and improving conversation,
which a well cultivated mind and a correct
taste are calculated to afford.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, said I, to myself, this be the beauty and
the wit of polished society, restore me again
to the native simplicity and sincerity of Harmony-Grove.</p>

<p class='c000'>I took my leave as soon as politeness would
allow; and left them to animadvert upon me.
Independent for happiness on the praise or
censure of superficial minds, let me ever be
conscious of meriting approbation, and I shall
rest contented in the certain prospect of receiving
it. Adieu.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Beverly.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>I sympathize with you, my dear Sophia, in
the disappointment you received in your expectations
from beauty and wit.</p>

<p class='c000'>You may nevertheless derive advantage
from it. Your refined and delicate ideas raise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>you too far above the scenes of common life.
They paint the defects of your inferiors in
such lively colours, that the greater part of
the community must be displeasing to you.
Few, you should remember, have had the advantages
which you have enjoyed; and still
fewer have your penetrating eye, correct
taste, and quick sensibility. Let charity then
draw a veil over the foibles of others, and candor
induce you to look on the best and brightest
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is both our duty and interest to enjoy life
as far as integrity and innocence allow; and
in order to this, we must not soar above, but
accommodate ourselves to its ordinary state.
We cannot stem the torrent of folly and vanity;
but we can step aside and see it roll on, without
suffering ourselves to be borne down by
the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>Empty conversation must be disgusting to
every rational and thinking mind; yet, when
it partakes not of malignity, it is harmless in
its effects, as the vapour which floats over the
mead in a summer’s eve. But when malice
and envy join to give scope to detraction, we
ought to avoid their contagion, and decidedly
condemn the effusions of the ill-natured merriment
which they inspire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our sex have been taxed as defamers. I
am convinced, however, they are not exclusively
guilty; yet, for want of more substantial
matter of conversation, I fear they too
often give occasion for the accusation! A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>mind properly cultivated and stored with useful
knowledge, will despise a pastime which
must be supported at the expense of others.
Hence only the superficial and the giddy are
reduced to the necessity of filling the time in
which they associate together, with the degrading
and injurious subjects of slander. But
I trust that our improved country-women are
rising far superior to this necessity, and are
able to convince the world, that the American
fair are enlightened, generous, and liberal.
The false notions of sexual disparity, in point
of understanding and capacity, are justly exploded;
and each branch of society is uniting
to raise the virtues and polish the manners of
the whole.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR JULIA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>From your recommendation of Mrs. Chapone’s
letters; and, what is still more, from
the character given them by Mrs. Williams,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>I was anxious to possess the book; but, not
being able to procure it here, my clerical brother,
who was fortunately going to Boston,
bought and presented it to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am much gratified by the perusal, and
flatter myself that I shall derive lasting benefit
from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>So intricate is the path of youth, and so
many temptations lurk around to beguile our
feet astray, that we really need some skilful
pilot to guide us through the delusive maze.
To an attentive and docile mind, publications
of this sort may afford much instruction and
aid. They ought, therefore, to be carefully
collected, and diligently perused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anxious to make my brother some acknowledgment
for his present, I wrought and sent
him a purse, accompanied with a dedication
which I thought might amuse some of his
solitary moments; and which, for that purpose,
I here transcribe and convey to you.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The enclosed, with zeal and with reverence due,</div>
      <div class='line'>Implor’d my permission to wait upon you;</div>
      <div class='line'>And begg’d that the muse would her favor extend,</div>
      <div class='line'>To briefly her worth and her service commend.</div>
      <div class='line'>The muse, who by dear bought experience had known</div>
      <div class='line'>How little her use to the clergy had grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>With officious advice thus attacked the poor purse:</div>
      <div class='line'>Why, you novice! ’tis plain that you cannot do worse!</div>
      <div class='line'>If the end of your being you would ever attain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And honor, preferment and influence gain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go quick to the pocket of some noble knave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose merit is wealth, and his person is slave:</div>
      <div class='line'>Or enter the mansion where splendor appears,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pomp and eclat are the habit she wears:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Or hie to the court, where so well you are known,</div>
      <div class='line'>So highly esteem’d and so confident grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>That without your assistance and recommendation,</div>
      <div class='line'>None claims any merit, or fills any station!</div>
      <div class='line'>Seek either of these; and with joy you’ll behold</div>
      <div class='line'>Yourself crown’d with honor, and filled with gold.</div>
      <div class='line'>But to wait on a priest! How absurd is the scheme;</div>
      <div class='line'>His reward’s in reversion; the future’s his theme.</div>
      <div class='line'>Will these, for the present, your craving’s supply,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or soften the din of necessity’s cry?</div>
      <div class='line'>Of hunger and want, the loud clamours repel;</div>

      <div class='line'>For poets and prophets the world has decreed,</div>
      <div class='line'>On fame and on faith may luxuriously feed!</div>
      <div class='line'>Here the puss interpos’d with a strut and a stare,</div>

<p class='c000'>I have spent a very agreeable summer in
the country; but am now preparing to return
to town. I anticipate, with pleasure, a restoration
to your society, and that of my other
friends there. I should, however, quit these
rural scenes with reluctance, were it not that
they are giving place to the chilling harbingers
of approaching winter. They have afforded
charms to me, which the giddy round of fashionable
amusements can never equal. Many,
however, think life insupportable, except in the
bustle and dissipation of a city. Of this number
is the volatile Amelia Parr, whom you
know as well as I. So extreme is her gaiety,
that the good qualities of her mind are suffered
to lie dormant; while the most restless passions
are indulged without restraint. I have
just received a letter from her, which you will
see to be characteristic of her disposition. I
enclose that, and my answer to it, for your perusal.
Read both with candour; and believe
me ever yours,</p>

<p class='c000'>Where are you, Harriot; and what are you
doing? Six long months absent from the
town! What can you find to beguile the tedious
hours? Life must be a burden to you!
How can you employ yourself? Employ, did
I say? Pho! I will not use so vulgar a term!
I meant amuse! Amusement surely is the
prime end of our existence! You have no
plays, no card-parties, nor assemblies, that are
worth mentioning! Intolerably heavy must the
lagging wheels of time roll on! How shall I
accelerate them for you? A new novel may
do something towards it! I accordingly send
you one, imported in the last ships. Foreign,
to be sure; else it would not be worth attention.
They have attained to a far greater degree of
refinement in the old world, than we have in
the new; and are so perfectly acquainted with
the passions, that there is something extremely
amusing and interesting in their plots and
counterplots, operating in various ways, till the
dear creatures are jumbled into matrimony in
the prettiest manner that can be conceived!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>We</em>, in this country, are too much in a state
of nature to write good novels yet. An American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>novel is such a moral, sentimental thing,
that it is enough to give any body the vapours
to read one. Pray come to town as soon as
possible, and not dream away your best days
in obscurity and insignificance.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this boarding school, this Harmony-Grove,
where you formerly resided, has given
you strange ideas of the world. With what
raptures I have heard you relate the dull
scenes in which you were concerned there!
I am afraid that your diseased taste has now
come to a crisis, and you have commenced
prude in earnest! But return to your city
friends; and we will lend our charitable assistance,
in restoring you to gaiety and pleasure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Your letter——your rattle, rather, came to
hand yesterday. I could not avoid smiling at
your erroneous opinions; and, in my turn, beg
leave to express my wonder at your entertainments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>in town. True, we have no plays. We
are not obliged by fashion, to sit, half suffocated
in a crowd, for the greater part of the
night, to hear the rantings, and see the extravagant
actions of the buskin heroes, (and
those not always consistent with female modesty
to witness!) We have no card-parties,
avowedly formed for the purpose of <em>killing
time</em>! But we have an agreeable neighborhood,
among which we can easily collect a
social circle; and persons of taste, politeness
and information, compose it. Here we enjoy
a rational and enlivening conversation, which
is at once refined and improving. We have
no assemblies, composed of a promiscuous
crowd of gaudy belles and beaux; many of
whom we should despise in a private company,
and deem unworthy of our notice. But we
have genteel balls, the company of which is
select, none being admitted but such as do
honor to themselves and each other. The
amusement is not protracted till the yawning
listlessness of the company proclaims their incapacity
for enjoyment; but we retire at a
seasonable hour, and add to the pleasure of
the evening, that of undisturbed rest through
the night. Of course, we can rise with the
sun, and sip the nectarious dews, wafted in the
aromatic gale. We breakfast before the heat
of the day has brought on a languor and deprived
us of appetite; after which, we amuse
ourselves with our needles, books, or music;
recline on the sofa, or ramble in the grove, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fancy or convenience directs. In the shady
bower we enjoy either the luxury of solitude,
or the pleasures of society; while you are, the
whole time, in the midst of hurry and bustle.
Eager in the chase, <em>you</em> fly from one scene of
dissipation to another; but the fatigue of this
ceaseless round, and the exertion of spirits necessary
to support it, render the objects of
pursuit tasteless and insipid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which mode of life, yours or mine, do you
now think the most rational, and productive of
the greatest happiness? The boarding school,
which you affect to despise, has, it is true,
formed my taste; and I flatter myself that I
shall never wish it altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall soon return to town; but not for
pleasure. It is not in crowds that I seek it.
Adieu.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR SOPHIA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Having been with my aunt Burchel for a
fortnight past, I have indulged myself in reading
novels; with which her library is well
supplied.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Richardson’s works have occupied a large
portion of the time. What a surprising command
has this great master of the passions
over our feelings! It is happy for his own and
succeeding ages, that he embarked in the
cause of virtue. For his influence on the affections
of his readers is so great, that it must
have proved very pernicious, had he enlisted
on the side of vice. Though I am not much
of a novel-reader, yet his pen has operated
like magic on my fancy; and so extremely
was I interested, that I could have dispensed
with sleep or food for the pleasure I found in
reading him.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this circumstance I am more than ever
convinced of the great caution which ought to
be used in perusing writings of the kind. How
secretly and how insidiously may they undermine
the fabric of virtue, by painting vice and
folly in the alluring colours, and with the lively
style of this ingenious author. The mind
should be well informed, and the judgment
properly matured, before young people indulge
themselves in the unrestrained perusal of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The examples of virtue and noble qualities,
exhibited by the author I have mentioned, are
truly useful; but every writer of novels is not
a Richardson: and what dreadful effects might
the specious manners of a Lovelace have on
the inexperienced mind, were they not detected
by a just exhibition of his vices!</p>

<p class='c000'>The noble conduct of Clementina and Miss
Byron, are worthy of imitation; while the indiscretion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of Clarissa, in putting herself under
the protection of a libertine, is a warning to
every fair. But both examples are often overlooked.
While the ear is charmed with the
style, and the fancy riots on the luxuriance of
description, which so intimately blend the
charms of virtue and the fascinations of vice,
they are not readily distinguished by all.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am not equally pleased with all Richardson’s
writings; yet so multifarious are his excellencies,
that his faults appear but specks,
which serve as foils to display his beauties to
better advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before I went from home I was engaged in
reading a course of history; but I fear I shall
not return from this flowery field to the dry
and less pleasing path of more laborious studies.
This is one disadvantage of novel reading.
It dissipates the ideas, relaxes the mind,
and renders it inattentive to the more solid
and useful branches of literature. Adieu.</p>

my parents and friends, seconded by my own

<p class='c000'>Indeed, my dear Harriot, you are making
an important change of situation; a change
interesting to you and your friends; a change
which involves not only your own happiness,
but the happiness of the worthy man whom
you have chosen; of the family, over which
you are to preside; and perhaps, too, of that
with which you are to be connected.</p>

<p class='c000'>I rejoice to hear that this connexion, on
which so much depends, is not hastily formed;
but that it is the result of long acquaintance,
is founded on merit, and consolidated by esteem.
From characters like yours, mutually
deserving and excellent, brilliant examples of
conjugal virtue and felicity may be expected.
Yet as human nature is imperfect, liable to errors,
and apt to deviate from the line of rectitude
and propriety, a monitorial guide may be
expedient and useful. Your partiality has led
you to request this <em>boon</em> of me; but diffidence
of my own abilities compels me to decline the
arduous task. Nevertheless, I have it happily
in my power to recommend an abler instructor,
who has written professedly upon the subject.
<span class='sc'>The American Spectator</span>, or <span class='sc'>Matrimonial
Preceptor</span>, lately published by Mr.
David West, of Boston, contains all you can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>wish. The judicious compiler has collected
and arranged his materials with admirable skill
and address. Peruse this book, and you will
be at no loss for counsels to direct, and cautions
to guard you through the intricate cares
and duties of the connubial life. The essays
are, chiefly, extracted from the most approved
English writers. The productions of so many
able pens, properly disposed, and exhibited in
a new and agreeable light, must not only be
entertaining, but useful to every reader of
taste and judgment. I wish this publication
to be considered as a necessary piece of furniture
by every housekeeper. The editor has
certainly deserved well of his country; and
Hymen should crown him with unfading garlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall visit you, my dear Harriot, after the
happy knot (for such I flatter myself it will
prove) is tied. In the mean time, I subscribe
myself, with the most ardent wishes for your
prosperity and happiness, your sincere friend,</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Newburyport.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>What think you of wit, Cleora? If you estimate
it by the worth of your own, you think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>it an invaluable jewel. But this jewel is variously
set. Yours is in the pure sterling gold
of good sense: yet, as displayed by some, it
glistens on the mere tinsel of gaiety, which
will not bear the scrutinizing eye of judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday I received a visit from a young
lady, lately moved into this neighbourhood,
who is reputed a wit. Her conversation reminded
me of Pope’s satirical remark:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There are, whom Heaven has bless’d with store of wit;</div>
      <div class='line'>But want as much again to manage it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I found her’s to consist in smart sayings,
lively repartees, and ludicrous allusions.</p>

<p class='c000'>So strong was her propensity to display this
talent, that she could not resist any temptation
which offered, though it led her to offend
against the rules of politeness and generosity.
As some persons of real genius were present,
topics of literature and morality were discussed.
Upon these she was mute as a statue;
but whenever the playfulness of her fancy
could find a subject, she was extremely loquacious.
This induced me to suspect that the
brilliance of her imagination had dazzled her
understanding, and rendered her negligent of
the more solid and useful acquisitions of the
mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is it not often the case, that those who are
distinguished by any superior endowment,
whether personal or mental, are too much elated
by the consciousness of their pre-eminence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and think it sufficient to counterbalance every
deficiency?</p>

<p class='c000'>This, Mrs. Williams used to say, is owing
to the want of self-knowledge; which, if once
possessed, will enable us properly to estimate
our own characters, and to ascertain with precision
wherein we are defective, as well as
wherein we excel. But it is the misfortune of
us, young people, that we seldom attain this
valuable science, till we have experienced
many of the ills which result from the want of
it. Ambition, vanity, flattery, or some such
dazzling meteor, engrosses our attention, and
renders us blind to more important qualifications.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return to this same wit, of which I
was speaking. It is certainly a very dangerous
talent, when imprudently managed. None
that we can possess tends so directly to excite
enmity, or destroy friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>An ill-natured wit is of all characters the
most universally dreaded. People of this description
are always feared, but rarely loved.
Humanity and benevolence are essentially necessary
to render wit agreeable. Accompanied
by these, it cannot fail to please and entertain.</p>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Pernicious talent! flatter’d by mankind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet hated too.————————</div>
      <div class='line'>Sense is the diamond, weighty, solid, sound;</div>
      <div class='line'>When cut by wit, it casts a brighter beam;</div>

<p class='c000'>The first moment which I have been able
to snatch from the affectionate embraces of my
honored mamma, and my dear sister Maria, is
devoted to you. Judging by the anxious solicitude
of my own heart, I know you are impatient
to hear of my safe arrival. It is needless
to tell you how cordially I was received. You
have witnessed the mutual tenderness which
actuates our domestic circle. Where this is
the governing principle, it is peculiarly interesting
to sensibility. It is extremely exhilarating
to the mind to revisit, after the shortest
absence, the place of our nativity and juvenile
happiness. “There is something so seducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in that spot, in which we first had our existence,
that nothing but it can please. Whatever
vicissitudes we experience in life, however
we toil, or wheresoever we wander, our
fatigued wishes still recur to home for tranquillity.
We long to die in that spot which
gave us birth, and in that pleasing expectation
opiate every calamity.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The satisfaction of returning home, however,
has not obliterated the pleasure which I
enjoyed on my visit to you. Does not a change
of scene and situation contribute to the happiness
of life? The natural love of this variety
seems wisely implanted in the human breast;
for it enables us to accommodate ourselves
with facility to the different circumstances in
which we are placed. I believe that no pleasures
make so deep an impression on the memory,
as those of the first and most innocent
period of our lives. With what apparent delight
do persons, advanced in years, re-trace
their puerile feats and diversions! “The
hoary head looks back with a smile of complacency,
mixed with regret, on the season when
health glowed on the cheek, when lively spirits
warmed the heart, and when toil strung the
nerves with vigour.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The pleasures of childhood and youth, when
regulated by parental wisdom, and sweetened
by filial affection and obedience, must be grateful
to the recollection at any age: and for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>plain reason, because innocence and simplicity
are their leading traits. How soothing, how
animating, then, must be reflection, at the
evening of a life, wholly spent in virtue and
rectitude!</p>

<p class='c000'>Pope observes that “Every year is a critique
on the last. The man despises the boy,
the philosopher the man, and the Christian
all.” Happy are those who can take a retrospect
of all, with the supporting consciousness
that each part has been rightly performed!

<p class='c000'>I am impatient for an opportunity of returning
your civilities, my dear Matilda; and if
possible, of repaying you some part of the
pleasure, which you so liberally afforded me,
during my late visit to your hospitable mansion.
For this purpose, I must insist on the
performance of your promise to spend the
winter in town. It is true that I cannot contribute
to your amusement in kind. Yet, according
to the generally received opinion, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>variety is necessary to the enjoyment of life,
we may find ours mutually heightened by the
exchange. Delightful rambles, and hours of

but you may depend on all that friendship and
assiduity can substitute; and while the bleak

very local. Few are sought, in which the understanding
and affections can have no share.
For this reason, a select, not a promiscuous
acquaintance is cultivated. And however unfashionable
our practice may be deemed, we
can find entertainment, even in the dull hours
of winter, without recourse to cards. Almost
every other recreation affords some exercise
and improvement to the body or mind, or both;
but from this neither can result. The whole
attention is absorbed by the game. Reason
lies dormant, and the passions only are awake.
However little is depending, the parties are
frequently as much agitated by hope and fear,
as if their all were at stake. It is difficult for
the vanquished not to feel chagrin; while the
victors are gratified at the expense of their
friends. But the principal objection with me,
is the utter exclusion of conversation; a
source of pleasure, and of profit too, for which
I can admit nothing as an equivalent. Winter
evenings are peculiarly adapted to this rational
and refined entertainment. Deprived of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that variety of scenery, and those beauties of
nature, which the vernal and autumnal seasons
exhibit, we are obliged to have recourse to the
fireside for comfort. Here we have leisure to
collect our scattered ideas, and to improve, by
social intercourse, and the exertion of our
mental powers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our sex are often rallied on their volubility:
and, for myself, I frankly confess, that I am
so averse to taciturnity, and so highly prize
the advantages of society and friendship, that
I had rather plead guilty to the charge than
relinquish them.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR LAURA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Yours of the 9th ult. has just come to hand.
It gave me renewed experience of the truth of
the observation, that next to the personal presence
and conversation, is the epistolary correspondence
of a friend. I am preparing, with
the most lively sensations of pleasure, to gratify
my own wishes, and comply with your polite
invitation. The romantic beauty of the rural
scenes has forsaken me; and what can so
amply compensate for their absence, as the
charms you offer?</p>

<p class='c000'>I envy you nothing which the town affords,
but the advantages you derive from the choice
of society adapted to your own taste. Your
sentiments of the fashionable diversion of card-playing,
are, in my view, perfectly just. I believe
that many people join in it, because it is
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</span></i>, rather than from any other motive.
And as such persons generally pay the greatest
deference to Lord Chesterfield’s opinions
and maxims, I have often wondered how they
happened to overlook, or disregard his animadversions
upon this subject; and have felt a
strong inclination to tell them, that this <em>all-accomplished</em>
master of politeness, and oracle of
pleasure, expressly says, “All amusements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>where neither the understanding nor the senses
can have the least share, I look upon as frivolous,
and the resources of little minds, who
either do not think, or do not love to think.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We had a pretty party here, last evening;
and a party it literally was; for it consisted
entirely of ladies. This singular circumstance
was remarked by one of the company, who, at
least, pretended to think it agreeable, because,
said she, we can now speak without restraint,
or the fear of criticism. I confess that I was
not prude enough to acquiesce in her opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ladies of delicacy and refinement will not
countenance or support a conversation, which
gentlemen of sense and sentiment can disapprove.
As each were formed for social beings,
and depend on the other for social happiness,
I imagine that society receives its greatest
charm from a mutual interchange of sentiment
and knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Both sexes are reciprocal instruments of
each other’s improvement. The rough spirit
of the one is tempered by the gentleness of
the other, which has likewise its obligations to
that spirit. Men’s sentiments contract a milder
turn in the company of women, who, on
the other hand, find their volatility abated in
that of the men. Their different qualities, intermingling,
form a happy symphony. From
their intimate conjunction, their real advantages
must be common and inseparable; and as
for those ridiculous wranglings about superiority,
they may be reckoned insults to nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and betray a want of a due sense of its wise
and gracious dispensations.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Many ladies affect to think it inconsistent
with female reserve, to acknowledge themselves
pleased with the company of the other
sex; but while such are the objects and advantages
of a mixed society, I blush not to
own myself desirous of its cultivation. Adieu.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR CAROLINE,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I take the liberty to send you Bennet’s
Letters. When my mamma put them into my
hand, Sophia, said she, I recommend this book
to your attentive perusal. It highly deserves
it, and will richly reward your labour. You
have, indeed, completed your school education;
but you have much yet to learn. Improvements
in knowledge are necessarily progressive.
The human mind is naturally active
and eager in pursuit of information; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>we have various and continual means of accumulating:
but never will you have a more favourable
opportunity for the cultivation of your
mind, than you now enjoy. You are now free
from those domestic cares and avocations,
which may hereafter fall to your lot, and occupy
most of your time. Speculation must then
give place to practice. Be assiduous, therefore,
to increase the fund, that it may yield you
a competent interest, and afford you a constant
resource of support and enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c000'>With these words she withdrew, while I was
still listening to the sweet accents of maternal
tenderness and discretion, which vibrated on
my ear, even after her departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>I find it worthy the recommendation of so
good a judge. As a moral writer, the precepts
and observations of its author are excellent;
as a religious one, his piety is exemplary, and
his instructions improving. His selection of
books, which he deems most proper for our
sex, though too numerous, perhaps, may, notwithstanding,
assist and direct the young in
their course of reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who would not imitate his Louisa? In her
he has forcibly displayed the beauties of an
amiable disposition, and the advantages which
even <em>that</em> may derive from a virtuous and religious
education.</p>

<p class='c000'>These letters are not scholastic and elaborate
dissertations; they are addressed to the
heart; they are the native language of affection:
and they can hardly fail to instil the love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of virtue into every mind susceptible of its
charms.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you have not read them, I will venture to
predict that they will afford you entertainment,
as well as instruction; and if you <em>have</em>, they
will bear a second perusal. Indeed, every
valuable book should be re-perused. On a
first reading, our curiosity to know something
of all it contains, hurries us forward with a rapidity
which outstrips both the memory and
judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this predominant passion is gratified,
an attentive review will commonly furnish
many useful and important lessons, which had
nearly or quite escaped our notice before.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, by some, is deemed too laborious a
task. They prefer company and conversation
to reading of any kind; and allege, in defence
of their opinion, that a knowledge of the world,
and of human nature, together with that ease
and gracefulness of manners, which are of the
utmost consequence to all who would make a
respectable figure in life, are much better obtained
in this way, than by the cold and unimpassioned
perusal of books.</p>

<p class='c000'>But is not every acquisition of this sort
merely superficial? Need we not a guide, superior
to our own judgment and experience, to
point out the line of duty and propriety, in the
various conditions and relations of our existence?</p>

<p class='c000'>Our acquaintance with living characters and
manners can afford us but a very limited view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of mankind, in the different periods and stages
of society. The inquisitive mind labours to
extend its knowledge to the most distant climes
and remote antiquity; and craves other materials
for the exercise of its reflecting powers,
than can be derived from occasional and desultory
conversation. Now, by what means
can this laudable curiosity be so effectually
satisfied, as by the perusal of judicious and
well chosen books? Not that I would depreciate
the value of good company (for I esteem
it highly;) but add its many advantages to
those which reading affords. This combination
must have a happy tendency to give us
possession, both of the virtues and graces;
and to render our attainments at once solid
and ornamental.</p>

<p class='c000'>What think you, Caroline? Do you agree
with me in opinion? Let me hear from you
by the first opportunity; and believe me
yours most sincerely.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Newburyport.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>I thank you, my dear friend, for the book
you were so obliging as to send me; and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the letter which accompanied it. The book
I had read; but as you justly observe, I
must be a gainer by a second perusal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the subject of reading, I perfectly accord
with you in sentiment. It is an amusement,
of which I was always enthusiastically
fond. Mrs. Williams regulated my taste;
and, by directing and maturing my judgment,
taught me to make it a source of refined and
substantial pleasure. I do not wish to pursue
study as a profession, nor to become a
learned lady; but I would pay so much attention
to it, as to taste the delights of literature,
and be qualified to bear a part in rational
and improving conversation. Indeed, I
would treasure up such a fund of useful
knowledge, as may properly direct my course
through life, and prove an antidote against
the vexations and disappointments of the
world. I think, Sophia, that our sex stand in
special need of such a resource to beguile the
solitary hours which a domestic station commonly
imposes. Is it not for the want of this
that some females furnish a pretext for the
accusation (which is illiberally brought against
all) of having recourse to scandal, and the
sallies of indelicate mirth? Conversation requires
a perpetual supply of materials from
the mind: and accordingly as the mind has
been cultivated or neglected, dignified or degrading
subjects will be introduced.</p>

<p class='c000'>I received a letter yesterday from our lively
and lovely friend, Anna Williams. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>delightfully blended in this charming girl, are
vivacity and sentiment, ease and propriety.
Adieu.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c008'><em>To Miss</em> MARIA WILLIAMS.</h3>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Boston.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>So often, my dear Maria, has the pen of
the divine, the moralist, and the novelist been
employed on the subject of female frailty and
seduction; and so pathetically has each described
the folly and misery of the fatal delusion
which involves many in disgrace, that I
am astonished when I see those, who have
the best means of information, heedlessly sacrificing
their reputation, peace and happiness
to the specious arts of the libertine! In this
case it is common for our sex to rail against
the other, and endeavor to excite the pity of
the world by painting the advantage which has
been taken of their credulity and weakness.
But are we not sufficiently apprised of the enemies
we have to encounter? And have we
not adequate motives to circumspection and
firmness?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>I am generally an advocate for my own sex—but
when they suffer themselves to fall a
prey to seducers, their pusillanimity admits no
excuse. I am bold to affirm that every woman,
by behaving with propriety on all occasions,
may not only resist temptation, but
repel the first attempts upon her honor and
virtue.</p>

<p class='c000'>That levity of deportment, which invites
and encourages designers, ought studiously
to be avoided. Flattery and vanity are two
of the most dangerous foes to the sex. A
fondness for admiration insensibly throws
off their guard, and leads them to listen and
give credit to the professions of those who
lie in wait to deceive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following remarks, though severe, perhaps
can hardly be deemed inconsistent with
the character which their author assumes.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
“Women would do well to forbear their declamations
against the falsity and wickedness
of men; the fault is theirs, to fall into such
coarse-spun snares as are laid for them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>“That servile obsequiousness which woman
should immediately look upon as the
mark of fraud, and which should make them
apprehend a surprise, is the very thing which
allures them, and renders them soon the victims
of perjury and inconstancy; the just punishment
of a disposition which fixes their inclinations
on superficial qualities. It is this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>disposition which draws after them a crowd of
empty fops, who if they have any meaning at
all, it is only to deceive. Something pleasing
in a man’s person, a giddy air, a perpetual
levity, supply the place of valuable endowments.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A recent and singular adventure has rendered
observations of this sort peculiarly
striking to my mind; which may account for
the subject and the length of this letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will give you a detail of it, though I must
conceal the real names of the parties concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday, the weather being very fine, and
the sleighing excellent, several of our family,
with two or three friends, were induced to
make an excursion a few miles in the country.
We stopped at a house which had formerly
been a tavern, and in which we had often been
well entertained on similar occasions. As
we were in haste to receive the benefit of a
good fire, we did not notice the removal of the
sign, nor advert to the possibility of its being
converted into a private mansion. Being very
cold, I stepped first out of the sleigh and ran
hastily in; leaving the gentlemen to exercise
their gallantry with the other ladies. The
room I entered had no fire. I therefore opened
the door which led to the next apartment,
when I beheld the beautiful and admired Clarinda
sitting in an easy chair, pale and wan,
with an infant in her arms! I stood mute and
motionless, till the woman of the house appeared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to conduct me to another room. Confusion
and shame were visibly depicted in
Clarinda’s countenance; and, unable to meet
my eye, she threw her handkerchief over her
face, and fell back in the chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>I followed the good woman, and apologising
for my intrusion, told her the cause. She recollected
my having been there before, and
readily excused my freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the rest of the company, who
had been shown into a decent parlour, were
inquiring for me; and I could scarcely find
opportunity to request my conductress to ask
Clarinda’s forgiveness in my name, and to assure
her of my silence, before I had joined
them. I assumed an appearance of cheerfulness
very foreign to the feelings of my heart,
and related my mistake without any mention
of the melancholy discovery I had made. We
prevailed on the woman to accommodate us
with tea and coffee, as we wished to ride no
further. While preparations were making she
came in to lay the table, and as she withdrew,
gave me a token to follow her; when she informed
me that Clarinda had been extremely
overcome by my detecting her situation, but
being somewhat recovered desired a private interview.
I accordingly repaired to her apartment,
where I found her bathed in tears.
Pity operated in my breast, and with an air of
tenderness I offered her my hand; but she
withheld hers, exclaiming in broken accents,
O no! I am polluted—I have forfeited your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>friendship—I am unworthy even of your compassion.</p>

<p class='c000'>I begged her to be calm, and promised her
that she should suffer no inconvenience from
my knowledge of her condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>She thanked me for my assurances, and
subjoined that, since she knew the candor and
generosity of my disposition, she would entrust
me with every circumstance relative to
her shameful fall; when, after a considerable
pause, she proceeded nearly in the following
words.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Though our acquaintance has been for
some time suspended, and though we have
lived in different parts of the town, yet common
fame has doubtless informed you that I
was addressed by the gay, and to me, too
charming Florimel! To the most captivating
form, he superadded the winning graces of
politeness, and all those insinuating arts which
imperceptibly engage the female heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His flattering attentions, and apparent ardour
of affection, were to my inexperienced
and susceptible mind, proofs of his sincerity;
and the effusions of the most lively passion,
were returned with unsuspecting confidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father, strict in his principles, and
watchful for my real welfare, disapproved his
suit; alleging that although Florimel was calculated
to please in the gayer moments of life,
he was nevertheless destitute of those sentiments
of religion and virtue, which are essentially
requisite to durable felicity. But I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>could not be persuaded that he lacked any
perfection which maturer years would not
give him; and therefore finding my attachment
unconquerable, my father reluctantly
acquiesced in the proposed connexion. My
ill-judged partiality for this ungenerous man
absorbed every other passion and pursuit;
while he took advantage of my yielding fondness,
and assumed liberties which I knew to
be inconsistent, with delicacy, but had not resolution
to repel. One encroachment succeeded
another, and every concession was claimed
and granted as a proof of love, till at length
he became absolute master of my will and my
person. Shame and remorse soon roused me
to a sense of my guilt, and I demanded an immediate
performance of his promise of marriage.
This, under one pretext or another, he
constantly evaded. His visits daily became
less frequent, and his attentions less assiduous—while
the most poignant anguish of mind
deprived me of every comfort. I found myself
reduced to the humiliating alternative of
entreating my seducer to screen me from infamy
by the name of wife, though he should
never consider or treat me as such. To this
he insultingly replied, that my situation must
necessarily detect our illicit commerce; and
his pride could never brook the reputation of
having a wife whose chastity had been sacrificed.
As soon as rage and resentment, which
at first took from me the power of utterance,
would permit, Wretch! exclaimed I, is it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>to you the sacrifice has been made? Who
but you has triumphed over my virtue, and
subjected me to the disgrace and wretchedness
I now suffer? Was it not in token of my
regard for you that I yielded to your solicitations?
And is this the requital I am to receive?
Base, ungrateful man! I despise
your meanness! I detest the ungenerous
disposition you betray, and henceforth reject
all intercourse and society with you! I will
throw myself on the mercy of my injured parents,
and renounce you forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Seeing me almost frantic, he endeavored
to soothe and appease me. He apologized
for the harshness of his language, and even
made professions of unabated affection; but
gave as a reason for deferring the conjugal
union, at present, that commercial affairs obliged
him to sail immediately for Europe; assuring
me at the same time that on his return
he would not fail to renew and consummate
the connexion. To this I gave no credit, and
therefore made no reply. He then requested
me to accept a purse to defray my expenses,
during his absence, which I rejected with disdain;
and he departed. The distress and
despair of my mind were inexpressible. For
some days I resigned myself entirely to the
agonizing pangs of grief. My parents imputed
my dejection to Florimel’s departure, and
strove to console me. It was not long, however,
before my mother discovered the real
cause. In her, resentment gave place to compassion;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>but the anger of my father could not
be appeased. He absolutely forbade me his
presence for some time; but my mother at
length prevailed on him to see, and assure me
of forgiveness and restoration to favor, if I
would consent to renounce and disown my
child; to which, not then knowing the force
of maternal affection, I readily consented.
This place was privately procured for me,
and hither, under pretence of spending a
month or two with a friend in the country, I
retired. To-morrow my dear babe is to be
taken from me! It is to be put to nurse, I
know not where! All I am told is, that it
shall be well taken care of! Constantly will
its moans haunt my imagination, while I am
deprived even of the hope of ministering to
its wants; but must leave it to execrate the
hour which gave it birth, and deprive it of a
parent’s attention and kindness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As soon as possible, I shall return to my
father’s house; and as I am unknown here,
and you are the only person, out of our family,
who shares the dreadful secret, I flatter
myself that my crime may still be concealed
from the world. The reproaches of my own
mind I can never escape. Conscious guilt
will give the aspect of accusation to every eye
that beholds me; and however policy may
compel me to wear the mask of gaiety and
ease, my heart will be wrung with inexpressible
anguish by the remembrance of my folly,
and always alive to the distressing sensations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of remorse and shame! Oh Julia! you have
witnessed my disgrace! pity and forgive me!
Perhaps I once appeared as virtuous and respectable
as you now do; but how changed!
how fallen! how debased! Learn from my
fate to despise the flattery of the worthless
coxcomb, and the arts of the abandoned libertine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time I was summoned to tea; when
giving all the consolation in my power to the
unhappy Clarinda, I rejoined my company;
and to prevent their inquisitiveness about my
absence, told them I had been with a sick
woman, upon whom I had accidentally intruded
when I first came in; and that she had
detained me, all this time, by a recital of her
complaints and misfortunes. This account
satisfied their curiosity; but the melancholy
into which my mind had been thrown, was not
easily dissipated; nor could I, without doing
violence to my feelings, put on the appearance
of my usual cheerfulness and ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here my dear Maria, is a picture of the
frailty and weakness of our sex! How much
reason have we then to “watch, and pray,
that we enter not into temptation!”</p>

and sister, I subscribe myself yours most sincerely,</p>

      <div class='line'>MY DEAR FRIEND,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I was much affected by the wo-fraught
tale which you gave me in your last. We
cannot too much regret that such instances of
duplicity and folly are ever exhibited. They
are alike disgraceful to both sexes, and demonstrate
the debasing and fatal tendency of
the passions, when suffered to predominate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your observations upon our sex I believe to
be just, though many would probably deem
them severe. However, I think it not much
to the honor of the masculine character, which
the God of nature designed for a defence and
safeguard to female virtue and happiness, to
take advantage of the tender affection of the
unsuspecting and too credulous fair; and,
in return for her love and confidence, perfidiously
to destroy her peace of mind, and deprive
her of that reputation which might have
rendered her a useful and ornamental member
of society. True, we ought to take warning
by such examples of treachery and deceit;
yet how much more conducive to the honor
and happiness of our species, were there no occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to apprehend such ungenerous requitals
of our sincerity and frankness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday, my mamma took the liberty to
read that part of your letter, which contains
the story of Clarinda, to her pupils, and to
make such comments upon it as the subject
suggested; during which we could not but
observe the extreme emotion of one of the
misses, a most amiable girl of about sixteen.
When the paragraph respecting Clarinda’s
disowning her child was read, she hastily rose
and in broken accents begged leave to withdraw.
This was granted without any inquiry
into the cause; though our curiosity, as you
may well suppose, was much excited. After
we were dismissed, my mamma prevailed on
her to tell the reason of her agitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am,” said she, “the illegitimate offspring
of parents, whom I am told are people of fortune
and fashion. The fear of disgrace overcame
the dictates of natural affection, and induced
my mother to abandon me in my infancy.
She accordingly gave me away, with a large
sum of money, which she vainly imagined
would procure me kind and good treatment.
But unhappily for me the people to whom I
was consigned, availed themselves of their
security from inspection and inquiry, abused
the trust reposed in them, and exposed me to
the greatest hardships. As they were persons
of vulgar minds and unfeeling hearts, they did
not commiserate my friendless condition. My
quick sensibility incurred their displeasure or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>derision. I was often insultingly reproached
with the misfortune of my birth; while the tears
which these ungenerous reflections extorted
from me, were either mocked or punished. I
had a thirst for knowledge; but they allowed
me no time for acquiring it, alleging they
could not support me in idleness, but that I
must earn my living as they did theirs, by
hard labor. Oppressed by these insults, I
bore the galling yoke of their authority with
the utmost impatience. When screened from
observation, my tears flowed without restraint;
and the idea of my parents’ cruelty, in thus
subjecting me to infamy and wretchedness,
continually haunted my imagination. Sometimes
I fancied my mother in view, and exposing
my tattered raiment, expostulated with
her concerning the indignities I suffered, and
the unreasonable hardship of leaving me to
bear all the punishment of my guilty birth!
At other times I painted to myself a father, in
some gentleman of pleasing aspect; and fondly
indulged the momentary transport of throwing
myself at the feet of one, whom I could
call by that venerable and endearing name!
Too soon, however, did the reverse of parental
tenderness awake me from my delusive
reveries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In this manner I lingered away my existence,
till I was twelve years old; when going
one day to the house of a gentleman in
the neighborhood, to which I was often sent
to sell herbs, and other trifles, I was directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>into the parlor, where the most beautiful sight
in nature opened to my view; while the contrast
between my own situation, and that of
children blessed with affectionate parents,
gave me the most painful sensations. The
lady of the house was surrounded by her four
sons, the eldest of whom was reading lessons,
which she most pathetically inculcated upon
all. As the door was open, I stood some minutes
unobserved; and was so delighted with
the tender accents in which her instructions
were imparted, and the cheerful obedience
with which they were received, that I had no
disposition to interrupt them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At length I was seen, and bid to come in.
But when questioned about my errand I was
so absorbed in the contemplation of maternal
and filial love, exhibited in this happy group,
that my tongue refused utterance, and I burst
into tears. The children gathered around
and inquired what ailed the poor little girl?
But when the lady took me by the hand, and
kindly asked what was the matter, I could not
restrain or conceal my feelings. When my
tears had relieved me, I related the cause of
my grief; describing my own situation, and
the effect which its contrast had produced on
my mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She was affected by my story, and seemed
pleased with my sensibility; while the
children lamented my misfortunes, and artlessly
requested their mamma to let me come and
live with them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Little did I then expect so great a favor;
but to my surprise as well as joy, Mrs. ——,
the lady of whom I have been speaking, and
by whom I am put under your care, came a
few days after, and asked the people where I
lived, if they were willing to part with me.
By their consent she took me home, and has
ever since treated me like a child.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am now happy beyond expression. My
gratitude to my benefactress, who, guided by
a wise and good Providence, has snatched me
from obscurity and misery, and given me so
many advantages for improvement, is unbounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the idea that any helpless innocent
should be unnaturally exposed to the sufferings
which I have experienced, is insupportably
distressing to my imagination.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let my story, if possible, be told to Clarinda,
that she may be induced to have compassion
upon her defenceless offspring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>You are at liberty, therefore, my dear Julia,
to make what use you please of this letter. I
shall make no comments upon the subject of
it, nor add any thing more to its length, but
that I am affectionately yours.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>My contemplated visit to Harmony-Grove
must be deferred. A severe illness has lately
confined my mamma to her chamber. This
claimed all my time and attention, and called
me to a new scene of care; that of a family
which I was obliged to superintend during her
indisposition. Her recovery has, at length,
restored tranquillity and joy to our abode; but
she has not yet resumed the direction of her
household affairs. To this, she tells me she
is reconciled by the hope that experience
may render me an adept in domestic economy.
Indeed, Anna, I think this an essential
branch of female education; and I question
whether it can be acquired by mere speculation.
To me it is plain that every lady ought
to have some practice in the management of a
family, before she takes upon herself the important
trust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do not many of the mistakes and infelicities
of life arise from a deficiency in this
point?</p>

<p class='c000'>Young ladies of fashion are not obliged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the task, and have too seldom any inclination
to perform duties which require so much time
and attention; and with which, perhaps, they
have injudiciously been taught to connect the
idea of servility. Hence it is, that when
called to preside over families, they commit
many errors, during their novitiate, at least,
which are alike detrimental to their interest
and happiness. How necessary is it, then, to
avoid this complication of evils by a seasonable
application to those offices of housewifery,
which may one day become our province.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early rising, I find a great assistance in my
present occupation. It is almost incredible
how much may be gained by a diligent improvement
of those hours which are but too
commonly lost in sleep. I arose this morning
with the dawn. The serenity of the sky and
the fragrance of the air invited me abroad.
The calmness which universally prevailed
served to tranquillize my mind, while the receding
shades of night, and the rising beams
of day, formed a contrasted assemblage of the
beautiful, the splendid, the solemn, and the
sublime. The silence which pervaded the
surrounding scenery was interrupted only by
the melody of the feathered songsters, who
seemed to rejoice in this undisturbed opportunity
of praising their maker. My heart expanded
with gratitude and love to the all-bountiful
Author of nature; and so absorbed was
I in the most delightful meditations, that I
saw with regret the hour approaching which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>must again call me to the active duties of domestic
and social life. These however, are
objects of real moment, and cannot innocently
be disregarded. They give a relish to amusement,
and even to devotion, which neither the
dissipated nor the recluse can know. Adieu.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR HARRIOT,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I sincerely thank you for your affectionate
letter, by the last post, and for the book with
which it was accompanied. The very title is
sufficient to rouse the feelings and attract the
attention of the patriotic mind. Beacon-Hill
claims a conspicuous place in the history of
our country. The subject of this poem must
be highly interesting to every true American;
while the genius it displays cannot fail to
gratify every poetical taste. Philenia’s talents
justly entitle her to a rank among the literary
ornaments of Columbia.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>I have been reviewing Millot’s Elements
of Ancient and Modern History; and recommend
it to your re-perusal. It is undoubtedly
the most useful compendium extant. The
tedious minuteness and prolix details of sieges
and battles, negotiations and treaties, which
fatigue the reader and oppress the memory in
most works of the kind, are happily avoided
in this; while the elegance, simplicity, conciseness
and perspicuity of the style, render it
intelligible to every capacity, and pleasing to
every taste. To those who have a relish for
history, but want leisure to give full scope,
Millot is well calculated to afford both information
and entertainment. It is an objection,
commonly made by our sex to studies of
this nature, that they are dry and elaborate;
that they yield little or no exercise to the
more sprightly faculties of the mind; that the
attention is confined to an uninteresting and
barren detail of facts, while the imagination
pants in vain for the flowery wreaths of decoration.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a plausible excuse for those who
read only for amusement, and are willing to
sacrifice reason, and the enlargement of their
minds, to the gaudy phantom of a day; but it
can never be satisfactory to the person, who
wishes to combine utility with pleasure, and
dignity with relaxation.</p>

<p class='c000'>History improves the understanding, and
furnishes a knowledge of human nature and
human events, which may be useful as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>as ornamental through life. “History,”
says the late celebrated Gauganelli, “brings
together all ages and all mankind in one point
of view. Presenting a charming landscape
to the mental eye, it gives colour to the
thoughts, soul to the actions, and life to the
dead; and brings them upon the stage of the
world, as if they were again living; but
with this difference, that it is not to flatter, but
to judge them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The duties and avocations of our sex will
not often admit of a close and connected
course of reading. Yet a general knowledge
of the necessary subjects may undoubtedly be
gained even in our leisure hours; provided
we bestow them not on works of mere taste
and fancy, but on the perusal of books calculated
to enrich the understanding with durable
acquisitions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sincerest wishes for your health and
happiness glow in the breast of your affectionate</p>

      <div class='line'>MY DEAR MARIA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Since I wrote you last, I have made an
agreeable visit to my good friend Sylvia Star.
After rambling in the fields and gardens till
we were fatigued, we went into her brother’s
library. He was in a studious attitude, but
gave us a polite reception. We are come,
Amintor, said I. Be so kind as to furnish us
with some instructive page, which combines
entertainment and utility; and while it informs
the mind, delights the imagination. I am not
happy enough to know your taste respecting
books, said he; and therefore, may not make
a proper selection. Here, however, is an author
highly spoken of by a lady who has lately
added to the number of literary publications;
handing me Sterne’s Sentimental Journey.
I closed and returned the book. You have,
indeed, mistaken my taste, said I. Wit, blended
with indelicacy, never meets my approbation.
While the fancy is allured, and the
passions awakened, by this pathetic humourist,
the foundations of virtue are insidiously undermined,
and modest dignity insensibly betrayed.
Well, said he, smilingly, perhaps you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>are seriously inclined. If so, this volume of
sermons may possibly please you. Still less,
rejoined I. The serious mind must turn with
disgust from the levity which pervades these
discourses, and from the indecent flow of mirth
and humour, which converts even the sacred
writings, and the most solemn subjects of religion,
into frolic and buffoonery. Since such
is your opinion of this celebrated writer, said
he, I will not insult your feelings by offering
you his Tristram Shandy. But here is another
wit, famous for his “purity.” Yes, said I,
if obscene and vulgar ideas, if ill-natured remarks
and filthy allusions by purity, Swift undoubtedly
bears the palm from all his contemporaries.
As far as grammatical correctness
and simplicity of language can deserve the
epithet, his advocates may enjoy their sentiments
unmolested; but in any other sense of
the word, he has certainly no claim to “purity.”
I conceive his works, notwithstanding,
to be much less pernicious in their tendency,
than those of Sterne. They are not so enchanting
in their nature, nor so subtle in their
effects. In the one, the noxious insinuations
of licentious wit are concealed under the artful
blandishments of sympathetic sensibility;
while we at once recoil from the rude assault
which is made upon our delicacy, by the
roughness and vulgarity of the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Choose then, said Amintor, for yourself. I
availed myself of his offer, and soon fixed my
eyes upon Dr. Belknap’s History of New Hampshire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and American Biography; both
of which I have since read with the greatest
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this judicious and impartial historian,
we are led from its first settlement to trace
the progress of the infant colony. We accompany
its inhabitants in their enterprizes, their
dangers, their toils, and their successes. We
take an interest in their prosperity; and we
tremble at the dreadful outrages of the barbarous
foe. Our imagination is again recalled
to the gradual advance of population and agriculture.
We behold the wilderness blooming
as the rose, and the haunts of savage
beasts, and more savage men, converted into
fruitful fields and pleasant habitations. The
arts and sciences flourish; peace and harmony
are restored; and we are astonished at the
amazing contrast, produced in little more than
a century.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we return to the American Biography,
gratitude glows in our bosoms towards
those intrepid and active adventurers, who
traversed a trackless ocean, explored an unknown
region, and laid the foundation of empire
and independence in this western hemisphere.
The undaunted resolution, and cool,
determined wisdom of Columbus, fill us with
profound admiration. We are constrained to
pay a tribute of just applause to the generosity
of a female mind exemplified in Isabella,
who, to surmount every obstacle, nobly consented
to sacrifice even her personal ornaments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to the success of this glorious expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The daring spirit of Captain Smith, and the
prudence, policy and magnanimity of his conduct
to the treacherous natives, and to his
equally treacherous and ungrateful countrymen,
exhibit an example of patriotism and
moderation, which at once commands our applause,
and interests our feelings. While we
tremble and recoil at his dreadful situation,
when bending his neck to receive the murderous
stroke of death, the native virtues of our
sex suddenly reanimate our frame; and with
sensations of rapture, we behold compassion,
benevolence, and humanity, triumphant even
in a savage breast; and conspicuously displayed
in the conduct of the amiable though
uncivilized Pocahontas! Nor are the other
characters in this work uninteresting; and I
am happy to find that the same masterly pen
is still industriously employed for the public
good;<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and that a second volume of American
Biography is now in press.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How vain are our expectations! While the types were
setting for this very page, Dr. Belknap suddenly expired in
a fit.—<em>Printer.</em></p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In reviewing this letter, I am astonished at
my own presumption, in undertaking to play
the critic. My imagination has outstripped
my judgment; but I will arrest its career,
and subscribe myself most affectionately yours.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR ANNA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I retired, after breakfast this morning,
determined to indulge myself in my favorite
amusement, and write you a long letter. I
had just mended my pen and folded my paper,
when I was informed that three ladies waited
for me in the parlor. I stepped down and
found Lucinda P——, Flavia F——, and
Delia S——. They were gaily dressed,
and still more gaily disposed. “We called,”
said they, “to invite you, Miss Maria, to
join our party for a shopping tour.” Loath
to have the ideas dissipated, which I had collected
in my pericranium, for the purpose of
transmitting to a beloved sister, I declined accepting
their invitation; alleging that I had
no occasion to purchase any thing to day;
and therefore begged to be excused from accompanying
them. They laughed at my reason
for not engaging in the expedition.
“Buying,” said their principal speaker, “is
no considerable part of our plan, I assure you.
Amusement is what we are after. We frankly
acknowledge it a delightful gratification of
our vanity, to traverse Cornhill, to receive the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>obsequious congees, and to call forth the gallantry
and activity of the beaux, behind the
counter; who, you must know, are extremely
alert when we belles appear. The waving
of our feathers, and the attractive airs we assume,
command the profoundest attention, both
of master and apprentices; who, duped by
our appearance, suffer less brilliant customers
to wait, or even to depart without notice,
till we have tumbled over and refused half
the goods in the shop. We then bid a very civil
adieu; express our regret at having given so
much trouble; are assured in return that it
has been rather a pleasure; and leave them
their trouble for their pains.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A most insignificant amusement this, said I
to myself! How little can it redound to the
honor and happiness of these unthinking
girls, thus to squander their time in folly’s
giddy maze! They undoubtedly wish to attract
eclat; but they would do well to remember
those words of the satirist, which, with the
alteration of a single term, may be applied
to them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Columbia’s daughters, much more fair than nice,</div>

      <div class='line'>Worn in the public eye, give cheap delight</div>
      <div class='line'>To throngs, and tarnish to the sated sight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Viewing their conduct in this light, I withstood
their solicitations, though I palliated my
refusal in such a manner as to give no umbrage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Of all expedients to kill time, this appears
to me, as I know it will to you, the most ridiculous
and absurd.</p>

<p class='c000'>What possible satisfaction can result from
such a practice? It certainly fatigues the
body; and is it any advantage to the mind?
Does it enlarge the understanding, inspire
useful ideas, or furnish a source of pleasing
reflection? True, it may gratify a vitiated
imagination, and exhilarate a light and trifling
mind. But these ought to be restrained and
regulated by reason and judgment, rather than
indulged.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wish those ladies, who make pleasure the
supreme object of their pursuit, and argue in
vindication of their conduct, that</p>

      <div class='line'>“Pleasure is good, and they for pleasure made,”</div>

<p class='c000'>would confine themselves to that species
which</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Neither blushes nor expires.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The domestic virtues, if duly cultivated,
might certainly occupy those hours, which
they are now solicitous to dissipate, both with
profit and delight. “But it is time enough to be
domesticated,” say they, “when we are placed
at the head of families, and necessarily
confined to care and labor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Should not the mind, however, be seasonably
inured to the sphere of life which Providence
assigns us?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“To guide the pencil, turn th’ instructive page;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A proper attention to these necessary duties
and embellishments, would not only correct
this rambling disposition, but happily leave
neither leisure nor temptation for its indulgence.</p>

<p class='c000'>I intended to have given you some account
of my agreeable visit here; but the chit-chat
of the ladies I have mentioned, has occupied
a large portion of my time this morning, and
an engagement to dine abroad claims the
rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hope soon to embrace you in our beloved

<p class='c000'>The extracts which you transmitted to me
in your last letter, my dear Sophia, from your
favorite author, Dr. Young, corresponded exactly
with the solemnity infused into my mind
by the funeral of a neighbor, from which I had
just returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>I agree with you that the Night-Thoughts
are good devotional exercises. It is impossible
to read them with that degree of attention
which they merit, without being affected by
the important and awful subjects on which
they treat. But Young, after all, is always
too abstruse, and in many instances too gloomy
for me. The most elaborate application is
necessary to the comprehension of his meaning
and design; which when discovered often
tend rather to depress than to elevate the
spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thompson is much better adapted to my
taste. Sentiment, elegance, perspicuity and
sublimity are all combined in his Seasons.
What an inimitable painter! How admirably
he describes the infinitely variegated beauties
and operations of nature! To the feeling and
susceptible heart they are presented in the
strongest light. Nor is the energy of his language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>less perceivable, when he describes the
Deity riding on the wings of the wind, and directing
the stormy tempest.</p>

      <div class='line'>The sun oppress’d, is plunged in thickest gloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still horror reigns, a dismal twilight round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of struggling night and day malignant mix’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far to the hot equator crowding fast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where highly rarefy’d, the yielding air,</div>

      <div class='line'>Amazing clouds on clouds continual heap’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or whirl’d tempestuous by the gusty wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or silent, borne along, heavy and slow,</div>

      <div class='line'>Meantime, amid these upper sea’s condens’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Around the cold aerial mountain’s brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by conflicting winds together dash’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>The thunder holds his black tremendous throne,</div>

<p class='c000'>Conscious of our own weakness and dependence,
we can hardly fail to adore and to fear
that Divine Power, whose agency this imagery
exhibits to our minds. Nor are the devout
affections of our hearts less excited, when we
behold the same glorious Being arrayed in
love, and accommodating the regular succession
of summer and winter, seed time and harvest
to our convenience and comfort. When
nature, obedient to his command, revives the
vegetable world, and diffuses alacrity and

</div>

<p class='c000'>Aided in our observations by this pathetic
and pious writer, our hearts beat responsive to
the sentiments of gratitude, which he indirectly,
yet most forcibly inculcates in that devout
address to the Supreme Parent:</p>

<p class='c000'>By this beautiful poem we are allured to
the study of nature, and to the contemplation
of nature’s God. Our hearts glow with devotion
and love to the sovereign Lord and benefactor
of the universe; and we are drawn, by
the innumerable displays of his goodness, to
the practice of virtue and religion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>You may, possibly call me an enthusiast.
Be it so. Yet I contend for the honor, but
especially for the privilege, of being a cheerful
one. For I think we dishonor our heavenly
father by attaching any thing gloomy or
forbidding to his character. In this participation
of divine blessings, let us rather exercise
a thankful, and contented disposition.</p>

      <div class='line'>DEAR MADAM,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>By her desire in conjunction with my own
inclination, I inform you that Harriot Henly,
is no more——Yesterday she gave her hand,
and renounced her name together; threw aside
the sprightly girl we have been so long accustomed
to admire, and substituted in her
place the dignified and respectable head of a
family, in Mrs. Farmington.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have I not lost my amiable friend and associate!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Will not her change of situation tend
to lessen our intercourse, and alienate our affections?</p>

<p class='c000'>When I contemplate the social circle, so
firmly cemented in the bands of friendship, at
the boarding school, where the most perfect
harmony, ease and satisfaction presided, I
recoil at the idea of becoming less dear, less
interesting, and less necessary to each other.
It is with the utmost reluctance that I admit
the idea of rivals to that affection and benevolence
which we have, so long, and so sincerely
interchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charm however is broken. Harriot is
already married; and my friends are extremely
solicitous that I should follow her example.
But in a connexion which requires so many
precautions, before it is formed, and such uninterrupted
circumspection and prudence afterwards;
the great uncertainty of the event
inspires me with timidity and apprehension.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harriot put into my hands, and I read with
pleasure, the book which you recommended
to her on the subject. But still we wished for
your instruction and advice. The sentiments
of a person so dear and interesting to us, are
particularly calculated to engage our attention,
and influence our conduct. Relying, too,
on your judgment and experience, your forming
pen may render us more worthy objects of
attachment.</p>

<p class='c000'>We, however, unite in assuring you of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>gratitude for all past favours; and in presenting
our sincere regards to the young ladies.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am, with great respect, your affectionate

      <div class='line'>DEAR LAURA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The obligations under which you lay me,
by your generous confidence, and affectionate
expressions of regard, induce me again to assume
the Preceptress towards you, and to
gratify your wishes, by imparting my sentiments
on your present situation and prospects.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am told by my daughter, who had the honor
of bearing your letter, that you are what I
always expected you would be, an object of
general admiration. Yet, I trust, your good
sense will enable you duly to distinguish and
treat the several candidates for your favor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>It is, indeed, my young friend, a matter of
the most serious consequence, which lies upon
your mind, and awakens your anxiety.
Your friends are studious of your welfare, and
kindly concerned that the important die on
which the happiness of your life depends,
should be judiciously cast. You doubtless remember,
that I discoursed upon this subject in
my concluding lessons to your class.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disparity of tempers, among other things
which were then suggested, and which
you will doubtless recollect, was represented,
as tending to render life uncomfortable. But
there are other disparities which may be equally
hostile to your peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disparity of years is very apt to occasion
the indulgence of passions destructive of conjugal
felicity. The great difference between
the sprightly vivacity, and enterprise of youth,
and the deliberate caution, phlegmatic coldness,
and sententious wisdom of age render
them very unpleasant companions to each other.
Marriage between persons of these opposite
descriptions is commonly the result of pecuniary
motives, with one party, at least: the
suspicion of this, in the other, must necessarily
produce discontent, uneasiness, and disaffection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Age is naturally jealous of respect, and apprehensive
of being slighted. The most trifling
and unmeaning inattentions will therefore be
construed amiss. For an excessive desire of
being objects of supreme regard is almost invariably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>accompanied with a strong persuasion
of being the reverse. Hence accusations, reproaches
and restraints, on the one side, produce
disgust, resentment and alienation on
the other, till mutual and unceasing wretchedness
ensue. Indeed, where interest alone,
without this inequality of years, is the principal
inducement, marriage is seldom happy.
Esteem and love are independent of wealth
and its appendages. They are not to be sold
or bought. The conjugal relation is so near
and interesting, the mind as well as the person
is so intimately concerned in it, that something
more substantial and engaging than gold is
requisite to make it a blessing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marriage, being the commencement of a
domestic life, beside the many agreeable circumstances
attending it, has its peculiar cares
and troubles which require the solace of a
companion actuated by better principles, and
possessed of more amiable endowments than
outward splendor and magnificence can afford.
In the hour of sickness and distress,
riches it is true, can bestow bodily comforts
and cordials; but can they be made an equivalent
for the tender sympathy, the endearing
kindness, and the alleviating attention of a
bosom friend, kindly assiduous to ease our
pains, animate our prospects, and beguile the
languid moments which elude all other consolations?
The sorrows as well as the joys of
a family state, are often such as none but a
bosom friend can participate. The heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>must be engaged before it can repose with
ease and confidence. To a lady of sensibility,
the confinement of the body, without the
consent and union of according minds, must
be a state of inexpressible wretchedness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another situation, not less to be deplored, is
a connexion with the immoral and profane.</p>

<p class='c000'>How shocking must it be, to hear that sacred
NAME, which you revere and love, constantly
treated with levity and irreverence!
And how painful the necessity of being constrained,
for the sake of peace, to witness in silence,
and without even the appearance of disapprobation,
the most shameful outrages upon
religion and virtue! May you never taste the
bitterness of this evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intemperance is a vice, which one would
imagine no lady would overlook in a suitor.
But, strange to tell! there are those even among
our own sex, who think and speak of inebriation
in the other, at the jovial and well
furnished board, as a mark of conviviality and
good fellowship.</p>

<p class='c000'>How degrading and how dreadful must this
enormity appear to an interested, affectionate
and virtuous wife! What agonizing pangs of
mortification and anguish must she endure,
when she meets him, in whose society she delights;
whose return she has anticipated with
impatience, and whose happiness and honor
are the moving springs of her life, intoxicated
with wine; the powers of his mind suspended
by the poisonous cup, and every faculty absorbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>in the deadly draught! What a perpetual
source of dread and apprehension must
hence arise; and how often must the blush of
indignant virtue and wounded delicacy be called
forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gamester is an equally dangerous companion.
His family is robbed, not only of his
company and his talents, but of that property,
to the benefit of which they have an indisputable
claim. His earnings are squandered
among worthless and profligate associates
abroad; while the fruitful partner of his life,
and perhaps, too, a rising offspring, languish
at home for want of bread!</p>

<p class='c000'>How fatal is the tendency of such examples!
How can that father inculcate the duties of
piety, virtue and decency, who exhibits the
reverse of each in his own conduct? And
under what an unspeakable disadvantage,
must that mother labor, in the instruction and
education of her children, whose admonitions,
counsels, and directions are practically counteracted
by him who ought to bear an equal
share of the burden! The government and
superintendence of a family are objects of such
magnitude and importance, that the union and
co-operation of its heads are indispensably
necessary. It is a little commonwealth; and
if internal feuds and dissentions arise, anarchy
and confusion must ensue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Domestic happiness is the foundation of
every other species. At times, indeed, we
may enjoy ourselves abroad, among our friends—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>a good heart will return home, as to the
seat of felicity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“——Home is the resort</div>
      <div class='line'>Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where</div>
      <div class='line'>Supporting and supported, polish’d friends</div>
      <div class='line'>And dear relations mingle into bliss.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Since so much, then, depends upon a judicious
choice, how important is it, that you examine
well before you decide; and that you dispense
with no quality in the man to whom you
shall give your hand, which is essential to the
virtue and happiness of your life. For this
purpose, consult your judgment rather than
your fancy; and suffer not superficial accomplishments,
but solid merit to preponderate.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have now endeavored to point out the
most apparent and threatening dangers to
which you may be exposed. But though these
are avoided, many unforeseen accidents will
doubtless occur to cloud your sanguine hopes.
These, when there are no vices to produce
them, may arise from follies, and from
the indulgence of erroneous expectations.
Little misunderstandings sometimes occasion
disagreements which terminate in coldness
and disaffection, and plant a root of bitterness
which can hardly be eradicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let prudence, therefore, be your pole-star,
when you enter the married state. Watch
with the greatest circumspection over yourself;
and always exercise the tenderest affection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the most unwearied patience, and the
most cheerful acquiescence in the treatment of
your companion. Guard especially against
being affected by those little inattentions and
foibles, which too often give pain and umbrage
without design; and produce those remonstrances,
criminations, and retorts, which
are the great inlets of strife, and bane of
love.</p>

<p class='c000'>You must bear with calmness, every thing
that the sincerest desire of peace can
dictate; and studiously avoid every expression,
and even look, which may irritate and
offend. Your own happiness, you will consider
so intimately connected with that of your
husband, as to be inseparable; and consequently,
that all your hopes of comfort in this
life, and perhaps too, in the next, depend upon
your conducting with propriety and wisdom
towards him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I take the liberty, through you, to convey
my congratulations to Mrs. Farmington. May
her change of condition be happy, to the
full extent of our most sanguine expectations,
and benevolent wishes. I fully intended writing
her on the subject, but having unwarily
bestowed so much time upon you, that for the
present, I must forego the pleasure. Some
things in this letter, which you will doubtless
communicate, are applicable to her case.
These she will receive as friendly hints from
me; and I am confident that her known discretion
will continue to shed a benign and engaging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>influence upon her whole deportment
and render her uniformly respected and beloved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bearer is waiting, and I can only add,
that I remain your sincere and affectionate
friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pleasing hope with which you inspired
me, when we parted last, of receiving a visit
from you in town, has been constantly cherished.
I have anticipated your arrival with
the utmost impatience; but have endeavored,
notwithstanding, to beguile the slow-paced
hours by a useful and pleasing occupation;
the revision of my geographical studies.</p>

<p class='c000'>My papa has kindly procured me Doctor
Morse’s last and much improved edition of
Universal Geography, which with the assistance
of a pair of globes he possessed, has

When at school, I thought this the most agreeable
study allotted me; never deeming it
a task, but an amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>It affords me, as it must every true American,
the sincerest pleasure to be furnished
with the means of acquiring this favorite science,
by my own countryman; and the spirit
of Columbian independence exults in my bosom,
at the idea of being able to gain an accurate
acquaintance with my own and other
countries, without recourse to the labors of
foreigners.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think the present generation are under
special obligations to the active industry of Dr.
Morse, in providing us with that necessary
and rich fund of information, which his Geography
and Gazeteer contain. From these
sources we may derive a sufficient knowledge
of the world we inhabit, without departing
from our domestic sphere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Come then, my dear Cleora, and without
fatigue or expense, we will make the tour of
the globe together. After investigating the
local situation of different and distant climes,
we will turn to the historic page, and examine
the manners, government, character and improvements
of their inhabitants. We will
traverse the frozen wastes of the frigid zones,
and the burning sands of the equatorial region;
then return and bless the temperate
and happy medium in which we are placed;
and casting an eye around, exult in our peculiar

and good government, virtue and religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fine mornings of this season afford
many delightful hours, before the heat of the
day relaxes the mind and enervates the body.
Come, then, enjoy and improve these, in

      <div class='line'>DEAR MATILDA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Last Thursday, after having concluded the
usual occupations and sedentary amusements
of the day, I walked out, towards evening, to
enjoy the benefit of a cool and fragrant air,
and the serenity and beauty of those rural
scenes which have a powerful tendency to
soothe and tranquillize the mind. When I had
rambled in the fields to a considerable distance,
I crossed into the road, to return home
free from the inconvenience of the dew, which
had begun to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>I had not proceeded far, when I observed a
female, who had the appearance of youth and
misfortune, sitting by the wall in a pensive
attitude, with an infant in her lap. When I
approached her, she arose, and in the most
humble and pathetic accents, besought me to
direct her to some shelter, where she might
repose her weary limbs for the night. The
aspect and language of distress awakened my
compassion. To know she really needed
charity, was a sufficient inducement with me
to bestow it, without scrupulously inquiring
whether she deserved it or not. I therefore
told her to follow me, and I would conduct
her to a lodging.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we walked on, I questioned her respecting
the place of her nativity, her parentage,
and the reason of her being reduced to the
situation in which I had found her. She informed
me that she was born in Ireland: that
her parents brought her into this country before
her remembrance; that while she was
very young, they both died, and left her to the
protection and mercy of strangers; that she
was bandied one from another, in the village
where Providence had cast her lot, till she
was able to earn her own living: “and since
that time,” said she, “I believe the character
of an honest and industrious girl will not
be refused me.” How then, said I, came
you by this incumbrance? pointing to the
child. “In that,” replied she, “I am very
guilty. Brought up in ignorance of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>principles of decency, virtue, and religion,
which have kept you innocent, Madam, I was
ruined by a deceitful man, who, under the
mask of love, and with the most solemn promises
of marriage, betrayed my confidence,
and left me to reap the bitter fruits of my
credulity. The woman where I lived, when
she discovered my situation, ordered me to
leave her house immediately. It was no matter,
said she, how much I suffered, or what
became of me. On my own head, she told
me, my iniquity should fall; she would not
lighten the burden, if it were in her power.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Some of the neighbors informed me,
that she had reason to be severe upon my
fault, being once in the same condemnation
herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Having no friend who could assist me, I
applied to the selectmen of the town, who provided
for me till I was able to work, and then
told me I must shift for myself; offering, however,
to keep the child, which I refused, being
determined that it should never suffer
for want of a mother’s care, while I had life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am now wandering in pursuit of employment,
that the labor of my hands may support
myself and little one. This has been often
denied me, either for fear my child should be
troublesome, or because my character was
suspected. I have sometimes suffered so
much from fatigue and want, that I have despaired
of relief, and heartily wished both myself
and babe in the grave.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>On examination, I found her knowledge
confined entirely to domestic drudgery; that
she had never been taught either to read or
write. She appears, notwithstanding, to have
good natural sense; and a quickness of apprehension,
and readiness of expression, seldom
equalled in her sphere of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>I conducted her into the kitchen, and desired
she might have supper and a bed provided
for her. My mamma, whose benevolent
heart and liberal hand are always ready to relieve
the necessitous, was pleased to approve
my conduct; and having kept her through the
next day, and observed her disposition and
behaviour, hired her as a servant; and we
have reason to believe, from her apparent fidelity
and grateful exertions, that our kindness
will be well repaid. I have even extended
my charity further, and undertaken to teach
her to read. She is very tractable; and I
expect to be amply rewarded for my labor, by
her improvements.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, Matilda, it is melancholy to see our
fellow-creatures reared up, like the brute creation;
neither instructed how to live above
their animal appetites, nor how to die as Christians,
when they have finished their toilsome
career!</p>

<p class='c000'>This girl is only seventeen. Her age,
therefore, as well as her docility and submissiveness,
encourage the pleasing hope of restoring
her to the paths of rectitude and peace.
I shall endeavor, as opportunity offers, to instil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>into her susceptible mind, the principles
of virtue and religion; and, perhaps, I may
lead her to the love and practice of both, and
render her a useful member of society. Her
fate impresses more forcibly than ever, on
my mind, the importance of a good education,
and the obligations it confers. Had you or
I been subjected to the same ignorance, and
the same temptations, who can say that we
should have conducted better? How many
fall for want of the directing hand of that
parental love and friendship, with which we
are blessed! Contrasting our situation with
hers, how much have we to account for, and
how inexcusable shall we be, if we violate our
duty, and forfeit our dignity, as reasonable
creatures.</p>

<p class='c000'>That extreme bitterness and acrimony,
which is sometimes indulged against persons
who are unhappily seduced from the way of
virtue, may operate as a discouragement to all
designs and endeavors to regain it; whereas,
the soothing voice of forgiveness, and the
consequent prospect of being restored to reputation
and usefulness, might rouse the attention,
and call forth the exertions of some, at
least, who through despair of retrieving their
characters, abandon themselves to vice, and
adopt a course, alike disgraceful to their sex,
and to human nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though I advocate the principles of
philanthropy and Christian charity, as extending
to some very special cases, I am far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>from supposing this fault generally capable of
the least extenuation. Whatever allowance
may be made for those, whose ignorance occasions
their ruin, no excuse can be offered
for others, whose education, and opportunities
for knowing the world and themselves, have
taught them a better lesson.</p>

<p class='c000'>I need not, however, be at the pains to enforce
this truth upon you: and, as my head
is so full of the subject, that I have no disposition
to write upon any thing else, I will
put an end to this incoherent scroll, by annexing
the name of your sincere and faithful
friend,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR CAROLINE,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Happening to be in my chamber, this morning,
the maid came running up stairs in such
violent haste, as to put herself fairly out of
breath. Will you be so kind, Miss Sophia, said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>she, as to lend me a quarter of a dollar? I
put my hand into my pocket, and found I had
no small change. I have nothing less than a
dollar, Susan, said I; but if it is a matter of
consequence to you, I will go to my mamma,
and procure it for you. She was loath to give
me that trouble; but, if I would, it would
really oblige her very much indeed. Her solicitude
excited my curiosity. Will you inform
me what you want it for? said I. O
yes; she believed it was no harm—But there
was a woman in the wood-house who told fortunes;
and she wished to know hers, but
could not without the money. A woman who
tells fortunes! said I. What fortunes? the
past or the future? The future, to be sure,
Ma’am, replied she. Ay, how does she know
them? said I. Has she been let into the secret
designs of Providence? or can she divine
the mysteries of fate? She tells fortunes
by cards, Ma’am, said she; and I really believe
she tells true. Can you imagine, said I,
that a knowledge of your destiny in life, is to
be gained from any possible arrangement of
a pack of cards? Why not Ma’am? Many
people have been told exactly what was to
happen. You may depend on it, Susan, said
I, you are deceived. The Almighty who disposes
all events according to his sovereign
pleasure, does not unveil futurity to mortals,
especially to such mortals, who by an idle,
vicious course of life, counteract his laws, and
disregard his authority. I would willingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>give you the money, twice told, if you needed
it; but I cannot consent to your being imposed
on by this worthless vagrant, who has
no other design than to pick your pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl departed at these words; and
though I felt an emotion of regret at refusing
to gratify her, yet my reason and conscience
forbad my being accessary to the fraud.</p>

<p class='c000'>This curiosity to explore the hidden counsels
of the Most High, prevails not only among
servants, but even many from whom
better things might be expected, are under its
infatuating influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Supreme Being has, for wise and benevolent
reasons, concealed from us the future
incidents of our lives. A humble reliance on
his power and goodness, accompanied with a
cheerful submission to the dispensations of his
providence, is what the Lord our God requireth
of us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have heard my mamma relate an anecdote
of a particular friend of hers, who was imposed
on very seriously in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>A gentleman, whom I shall call Sylvander,
was very deeply in love with her; but his
person, and, much more, his disposition and
manners, were extremely disgusting to her.
Averse to the very idea of a connexion with
him, she accordingly refused his addresses.
Yet he had art sufficient to interest her friends
in his behalf; who, pitying his situation, endeavored
to soften the heart of the obdurate
fair. But in vain they strove to conciliate
her affections.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>In defiance of all opposition, however, he
intruded his visits, till she reluctantly admitted
them; and being somewhat coquetish, she at
times received him more benignly; which
flattered his hopes of ultimately accomplishing
his wishes. Finding his ardent suit of but
little avail, and perceiving that he made but
small progress towards gaining her favor, he
had recourse to art. Surprising her one day
in close confabulation with a fortune-teller,
the idea immediately struck him, that he
might effect, through this mean, what all his
assiduity and solicitations could never insure.
He communicated his plan to a female friend,
who was equally the confident of both parties.
Directed by him, she conversed with Sylvia
on the subject; professed her belief in the
skill of these jugglers; and appeared desirous
of taking this measure to learn her fate. Sylvia
joined in her opinion and wishes; and
away they tripped together on the important
errand. Meanwhile, Sylvander had been to
the fellow who was to reveal their destinies?
and, bribing him to favor the design, left him
instructed what answers to make to their interrogations.</p>

<p class='c000'>They arrived and proposed their business.
The mediums of information, a pack of cards,
were brought forth, and mysteriously arranged.
Sylvia’s curiosity was on tip-toe. She
listened with profound attention to his oracular
wisdom; and believed him really inspired
when he told her that her former lover, for-whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>she had a great regard, was gone to a foreign
country. This she knew to be true and
therefore gave him a full credence, when he
added, that he would never live to return;
and when he proceeded still further to observe
that another gentleman of great merit now
courted her; that she was not fond of his addresses,
but would soon see his worth and her
own error, and give him her hand, and be
happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, he so artfully blended the past and
present, which she knew, with the future
which Sylvander wished, and had therefore
dictated, that she was firmly persuaded that
he dealt with some invisible power, and that
fate had indeed predestined her to the arms of
Sylvander. Convinced of this, she attended
to his overtures more placidly, contemplated
his person and endowments with less aversion,
and endeavored to reconcile herself to the unavoidable
event.</p>

<p class='c000'>This she effected; and not long after, he
obtained her in marriage, and triumphed in the
success of his duplicity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In process of time her other lover returned.
Disappointment and despair presided in his
breast. He saw Sylvia, upbraided her with
her inconstancy, and declared himself utterly
ruined. Pity and returning love operated in
her mind, and rendered her completely wretched.
She most severely condemned her own
folly, in listening to the dictates of a misguided
curiosity; and acknowledged herself justly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>punished, for presuming to pry in the secret
designs of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>These strolling pretenders to foreknowledge
are peculiarly dangerous to the weak-minded
and credulous part of the community; and
how it happens that they are encouraged, is
to me inconceivable. Did they actually give
the information they promise, how much
reason should we have to avoid them! How
many sources of grief would be opened, by
the anticipation of future evils, of which now
we have no apprehension! and how often
should we be deprived of the consolatory hope
of a speedy deliverance from present sufferings.</p>

<p class='c000'>With every sentiment of respect and affection,
I am most sincerely yours.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>DEAR ANNA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A most melancholy and distressing event
has spread a gloom over the face of the metropolis.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Every heart heaves the sympathetic
sigh, and every eye drops the tear of regret.
The very sudden death of Doctor
Clarke, who was seized with an apoplectic fit,
in the midst of his sermon, yesterday afternoon,
and expired this morning, is a subject of
universal lamentation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not only we, who had the happiness to sit
under his ministry, and to enjoy his particular
friendship and attention, but the whole town;
and, indeed, the public at large have sustained
a great loss in his departure. Amiable in
his disposition, engaging in his manners,
and benevolent in his whole deportment,
he conciliated the affections of every class.
His talents as a scholar, philosopher, and
divine, commanded the respect of the most
judicious and learned; while the elegance,
perspicuity and delicacy of his style, joined
with the undissembled seriousness of his manner,
rendered him uniformly acceptable to the
devout. In every condition and relation of
life, he was exemplary as a Christian; and as
a preacher, an air of persuasion invariably accompanied
him, which arrested the attention
of the most heedless auditors.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——“By him, in strains as sweet</div>
      <div class='line'>As angels use, the gospel whisper’d peace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Grave, simple and sincere: in language plain:</div>
      <div class='line'>And plain in manner. Decent, solemn, chaste</div>
      <div class='line'>And natural in gesture. Much impress’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Himself as conscious of his awful charge,</div>
      <div class='line'>And anxious mainly that the flock he fed</div>
      <div class='line'>Might feel it too. Affectionate in look,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>And tender in address, as well becomes</div>
      <div class='line'>A messenger of grace to guilty men.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He was particularly attractive to young
people. While he charmed their ear, he convinced
their understanding and excited them
to the love and practice of virtue.</p>

<p class='c000'>A striking example of this occurred some
years ago, which I will take the liberty to relate.
He preached in a neighboring church
on these words, “She that liveth in pleasure
is dead while she liveth.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> In this discourse
he painted those allurements of pleasure which
surround the young and gay; more especially
of our sex, in the most just and lively colours.
He represented, in pathetic, engaging and refined
language, the snares to which they are
exposed, and the most probable means of escaping
them. He exhibited with all their
attractions, the native charms of virtue, and
portrayed vice in its true deformity. He described
in the most animating terms, the respectability,
usefulness, and happiness of those
who undeviatingly adhere to the path of rectitude
and innocence; and with the most energetic
and affectionate tenderness, warned
the youth to avoid the devious walks of vice
and dissipation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of young ladies, who had been
his hearers, happening to be together in the
evening, united in the wish to express their
gratitude to him; but not having a personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>acquaintance with him, could devise no better
method than writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following anonymous letter was accordingly

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“The well known candour of your disposition,
and your apparent zeal for the promotion
of religion and virtue, embolden us to
flatter ourselves that you will pardon this
method of conveying to you our sincere and
united thanks for your very seasonable, judicious,
and useful discourse, delivered last
Sunday morning, at our meeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is much to be lamented, that the depravity
of the age is such, as to render sermons
of this nature just and necessary; and
it is almost matter of equal regret, that we
have so seldom opportunities of being benefitted
by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That we oftener hear than receive instruction,
is a truth which can neither be denied or
evaded; and can only be accounted for, by
that passionate fondness for pleasure, which
prevails to such a degree of enthusiasm, as
to precipitate its votaries into whatever presents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>itself under this deluding aspect, without
considering whether it be durable or fleeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is certainly a most humiliating reflection,
that our sex (which is the female) should
ever take more pains to gain the qualifications
of agreeable triflers than of rational friends;
or be more anxious to become amusing, than
useful companions. But sir, does not such
conduct in ladies too often receive the most
flattering encouragement from the gentlemen?
How seldom is intrinsic merit distinguished;
and the serious, prudent female preferred
even by those who style themselves men of
sense and penetration, to the airy, flaunting
coquette!</p>

<p class='c000'>“The constant attention which is paid to
those who make the gayest appearance, and
the applause which is lavished upon her who
has the largest portion of external graces and
fashionable embellishments, induce many who
entertain the good natured desire of pleasing to
bestow more of their time and care on the cultivation
of those superficial accomplishments,
which they find necessary to render them acceptable
to most circles in which they fall, than
upon the acquisition of those substantial virtues
which they daily see neglected and ridiculed;
though at the same time, perhaps they are convinced
of the superior satisfaction which the
latter would afford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it is needless for one sex to criminate
the other. We allow, that, generally speaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>they are equally to blame. In this instance,
however, as the male assume the prerogative
of superior judgment and intellectual
abilities, they ought to prove the justice of
their claim by setting nobler examples, and by
endeavoring to reform whatever tends to
vitiate the taste and corrupt the morals of society.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet, after all, the evil cannot be effectually
remedied, but by the concurrent exertions
of both; and we are humbly of opinion, that if
this reformation were more frequently inculcated
from the pulpit, in the delicate, engaging
and pious manner of the discourse which now
excites our gratitude to you, and our resolutions
to conduct accordingly, it would be efficacious
in bringing about so desirable an
event.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We entreat your pardon, Reverend Sir,
for the freedom, prolixity, and errors of this
epistle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Though personally unknown to you, we
doubt not you will readily grant it, when we
assure you, that we are actuated by a sincere
regard to the interests of religion and morality,
and by a grateful sense of your exertions in
the glorious cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The united sentiments of a number of
young ladies, who heard and admired your
sermon, last Sunday morning, are expressed
above.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rev. <span class='sc'>John Clarke</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>It is much to be regretted that Doctor
Clarke did not publish more of his literary labours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The universal approbation bestowed upon
those, which he suffered to see the light, is an
unequivocal evidence of his merit, as an author.
His “Letters to a Student in the University
of Cambridge,” are written in a
most pleasing style, and contain instruction
and advice of which no person in pursuit of a
public education ought to be ignorant. His
“Answer to the question, Why are you a
Christian?” which has already had three editions
in Boston, and three in England, is one
of the best compendiums of the external and
internal evidences of our holy religion, extant.
It is plain and intelligible to the lowest capacity
and may enable every one, without much
study, to give a reason for the hope that is in
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>From these specimens we may form an
opinion of what the world has lost by his early
exit.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall make no other apology for the length
of this letter, than the interest which I feel
in the subject; and this, I am persuaded, you
will deem sufficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>My affectionate regards wait on your mamma

      <div class='line'>DEAR MATILDA,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I was last week at Boston; and having
occasion for a new hat, stepped into a milliner’s
shop to inquire the mode. The milliner
replied that it was not yet in her power to answer
my question. “The spring ships,” said
she, “are later than common; but their arrival
is hourly expected, when we shall be furnished
with memorandum books which will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>ascertain and determine the fashion for the
season.” What she meant by memorandum
books, I could not conceive. I had always
supposed them blanks, designed for noting
whatever occurred without inconvenience. Unwilling,
however, to be thought a simple country
girl, totally unacquainted with the world,
I sought no explanation from her; but repaired
to a particular friend for instruction; from
whom I learned that the chief value of these
same memorandum books consists in their
containing imported cuts of ladies’ headdresses,
hats and other habiliments, which are
always sure to be admired and imitated, as the
perfection of taste and propriety.</p>

<p class='c000'>This discovery mortified me exceedingly.
It justified, beyond any thing which I had
ever suspected to exist as a fact, what I once
heard a European assert, “that Americans
had neither character nor opinion of their
own.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With due deference to those better judges,
who despise the simplicity of our ancestors,
and labor to introduce the corrupt manners
and customs of the old world into our country,
I cannot but think it extremely ridiculous for an
independent nation, which discards all foreign
influence, glories in its freedom, and boasts
of its genius and taste, servilely to ape exotic
fashions, even in articles of dress and fanciful
ornaments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Have not the daughters of Columbia sufficient
powers of invention to decorate themselves?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Must we depend upon the winds and
waves for the form, as well as the materials of
our garb? Why may we not follow our own
inclination; and not be deemed finical or prudish
in our appearance, merely because our
habit is not exactly correspondent with the
pretty pictures in the memorandum books, last
imported.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is sincerely to be regretted that this subject
is viewed in so important a light. It occupies
too much of the time, and engrosses
too much of the conversation of our sex.
For one, I have serious thoughts of declaring
independence.</p>

      <div class='line'>MY DEAR CAROLINE,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To tell you that I am sorry for your loss, or
that I sympathize in your affliction, would be
but the language you daily hear; and often
perhaps, from the unfeeling and indifferent.
But you will do me the justice to believe, that
I take a particular interest in your concerns,
and really share your grief. A holy Providence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>has wounded you by a stroke, which is
extremely painful and severe. Your best
friend is shrouded in the grave. In the maternal
breast our fondest affections, and most
unsuspecting confidence have hitherto concentrated;
and who can provide you with an equivalent
substitute? To the Almighty Father
and Friend of creation, it becomes you to repair
for comfort and support.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dying advice and counsel of your dear
mamma, which you inform me, were pathetic,
instructive and consolatory, will be a guide to
your feet. Often realize the solemn scene,
and remember, that, “though dead, she yet
speaketh.”</p>

<p class='c000'>You have great cause of thankfulness, that
she was spared to direct you so far through
the intricate and dangerous path of youth; to
complete your education; to teach you, by
her example, how to acquit yourself with usefulness
and honor; and above all, to furnish
you with that important knowledge, to which
every thing else should be made subservient—how
to die.</p>

<p class='c000'>An era of your life has now commenced,
which is no less important than affecting.
That assisting hand which formerly led you is
now cold and lifeless! Those lips, from which
you have been accustomed to receive information
and advice, are sealed in perpetual silence!
And that heart, which always glowed
with the warmest solicitude for your happiness
has ceased to palpitate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>You must now think and act for yourself.
As the eldest daughter, you will be placed at
the head of your father’s family. You must,
therefore, adopt a plan of conduct, conducive
to its harmony, regularity and interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Filial duty to your surviving parent, more
tenderly inculcated by your participation of
his heavy bereavement, will lead you to consult
his inclination, and sedulously contribute
all in your power to lighten the burden of domestic
arrangements devolved upon him.
While he laments the death of a prudent, affectionate,
and beloved wife, give him reason
to rejoice that he is blessed with a daughter,
capable of soothing the pains, alleviating the
cares, and heightening the enjoyments of his
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your brothers and sisters will look up to you
as the guide of their tender years. While their
weeping eyes and pathetic accents are directed
towards you, let kindness, discretion, and patience,
characterize your deportment, and
engage their confidence and love.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having mentioned your duty to others, I
cannot dismiss the subject without dropping a
few hints for your direction, in regard to your
personal behaviour.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very important charge is committed to
you, as well in the duties which you owe to
yourself, as in the superintendence of your
father’s family.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sovereign disposer of all things has, at
an early age, made you, in a measure, your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>own guardian. Your father’s business calls
him much abroad. With you, therefore, he
is obliged to entrust, not only his domestic
concerns; but, what is still more dear to his
heart, the care of your own person and mind;
of your own reputation and happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Circumstanced as you are, company has
the most powerful charms. Yours is now the
prerogative of receiving and returning visits
in your own name. At home, you are sole
mistress of ceremonies. This is extremely
alluring to the sprightly fancy of youth. But
time, you will remember, is too important a
blessing to be sacrificed to a promiscuous
crowd of unimproving companions. Besides,
the character of a young lady will necessarily
be sullied by the imputation of being constantly
engaged in parties of pleasure, and exhilarating
amusement. Flattery often avails itself
of the unguarded moments of gaiety; and insinuating
its insidious charms into the heedless
and susceptible mind, inflates it with pride
and vanity, and produces an affectation and air
of self-importance, which are peculiarly disgusting,
because easily distinguished from that
true dignity of manners, which results from
conscious rectitude. Genuine merit is always
modest and unassuming; diffident of itself and
respectful to others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Your father has a right to your unlimited
confidence. You will, therefore, make him
your chief friend and counsellor. Though he
may not possess all the winning softness of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>mother, he doubtless has as ardent an affection
for you, and as sincere a desire to promote
your welfare. Hence you may safely repose
your dearest concerns in his paternal breast,
and receive, with the utmost deference, his
kind instruction and advice. Let his judgment
have an entire ascendency over your
mind and actions, especially in your intercourse
and society with the other sex. Consider
him as better acquainted with their
merit, circumstances, and views, than you can
be; and should you contemplate a connexion
for life, let his opinion determine your
choice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Watch over your dear little sisters with all
the tenderness of fraternal affection; be their
protector and friend; instil into their minds
the principles of virtue and religion; arm
them against the snares and temptations by
which they will be surrounded; and lead them
by your own conduct, in the way of truth and
peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you have leisure and inclination to
write, the effusions of your pen will always be
acceptable to your sincere and faithful friend</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
